//! Pane's timer sample in Rust: a clock whose screen changes by itself —
//! the view asks Pane to render it again after every second
//! (`refresh-after-ms`, #236) — with its caption arriving as pending data
//! shown first as a loading state (`Pending` and `loading`), whose arrival
//! asks for a drawing itself (#243): it is shown the moment it lands, with
//! no timer to wait for. The behaviour matches the JavaScript and
//! TypeScript samples (`sample-timer-js`, `sample-timer-ts`): the same
//! texts, the same timings.
