//! A designed view, as an author writes it: a [`View`] whose `render`
//! answers a tree of [`Node`]s, built with [`column`], [`row`], [`text`],
//! [`button`] and every other node of the UI component set, whose
//! controls' `on_click` closures run with the view's state mutably
//! through [`Cx::listener`]. The SDK answers Pane's `render` with the
//! tree as the versioned JSON document of `docs/designed-tree.md` (ADR
//! 0036's envelope), names each listener by a per-render callback id, and
//! runs the closure Pane hands back — so an author never sees the JSON
//! or the ids.
//!
//! A command whose `pane.json` entry says `"mode": "designed"` opens a
//! view as its screen: [`Command::open_designed_view`] answers with the
//! view's state (its [`Command::DesignedView`]), and Pane never calls the
//! command's `render`. Pane asks for the tree again after each event, so
//! the view's `render` reads the state the event's listener changed. A
//! view that changes by itself asks for that: the answer of its render
//! names when Pane asks again ([`IntoNode::refresh_after`], #236), and
//! data on its way is shown as a loading state whose arrival asks for a
//! drawing itself ([`Pending`], #243) — see the timer sample
//! (`sample-timer`).
//!

//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Every node carries a [`Style`] — how it takes space, and the surface
//! it draws, with `hover` and `pressed` variants Pane applies itself —
//! set through the same-named methods on every builder. A colour a node
//! draws with is the tone token ([`crate::icon::Tone`]), a raw
//! colour, or a light and dark pair, each corrected for contrast by Pane
//! unless it is given as [`Paint::exact`]. Icons and images come from
//! [`crate::Icon`], the one icon model the list tree shares.
//!
//! The listeners of the last two renders are kept: a press of what the
//! user could see is delivered even if the view has rendered since, and
//! an older event is dropped. The component set's version is written into
//! every document; a Pane that renders another major refuses it naming
//! both versions, and one that knows less draws what it understands.
//!
//! A view's answer may navigate (#239): [`Cx::push`] pushes a view above
//! this one, [`Cx::replace`] replaces this view with one, [`Cx::pop`] and
//! [`Cx::pop_with`] pop it — with a result answered to the view below,
//! whose own `on_pop` (given to [`Cx::push_with`]) runs with it. The back
//! key pops a view without asking, delivering the pop event with no
//! result. [`Container::navigation_title`] names the view, shown where a
//! screen's title is.
