//! Guest-side bindings for Pane's `pane:extension` contract.
//!
//! An extension implements [`Command`] and calls [`export!`]: its screen is
//! a [`List`] of [`Item`]s whose actions are closures, which the SDK hands
//! Pane as the versioned JSON tree of ADR 0036's envelope (`render` and
//! `handle-event`) and runs when the user chooses them; its items may have
//! icons, accessories and tooltips ([`icon`]). Or, for a no-view
//! command, [`Command::run`] runs each time it is launched. Every command
//! receives its launch record and may launch another command with
//! [`commands`]. It tells the user what happened with a toast or a HUD
//! ([`feedback`]), and may close Pane's window or pop back to root search
//! ([`window`]); Pane shows nothing of an action's answer. It may keep
//! values between runs with [`settings`], and its own records, disposable
//! values and secrets with [`content`], [`cache`] and [`credentials`], and
//! read the preferences its package declares with [`preferences`]. It
//! may compute results from root search's query with [`root`], run a continuing
//! service while its package's code may run with [`service`], call
//! operations other packages publish with [`operations::call`] or a
//! capability by its name with [`capabilities::call`], serve the operations
//! its own package publishes and the capabilities it provides with
//! [`publish`], find and open installed
//! applications with [`applications`], supply root results ahead of the
//! query with [`indexed`], run its package's native helpers with
//! [`helpers`] and the system's own programs with [`programs`], list the
//! files of a folder with [`files`], search as the
//! user types into its own search field with [`search`], make web
//! requests with [`http`] and keep clipboard history with
//! [`clipboard_history`]. It registers at run time what it owns and no
//! declaration can name ([`registrations`], ADR 0041): dynamic root
//! items, timers, folder watchers and run-time capabilities its package
//! provides while it holds a provision for them — each a handle whose
//! drop undoes it, undone too when the instance that made it goes or the
//! package's code is replaced. A package whose `pane.json` declares
//! `"activate"` has that entry point called when its code may run
//! ([`lifecycle`]), so its registrations exist without waiting for the
//! user. It prints and logs to its package's extension log
//! with [`info!`], [`warn!`], [`println!`] and the like ([`log`]). The crate
//! is `no_std` so the component imports only WASI 0.3 interfaces; it supplies
//! the allocator and a panic handler that logs the panic and traps, which the
//! host reports as a runtime error.
//!
//! Without `std` no libc is linked, so the crate also supplies what the
//! compiler and the component runtime call into libc or `std` for:
//! `memcmp` and `bcmp`, which the compiler emits for byte and string
//! comparisons (`==` on `str`, `starts_with`, ...) as soon as a guest compares
//! strings, and the canonical-ABI `cabi_realloc`.
