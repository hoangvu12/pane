//! What a command registers at run time and owns (ADR 0041, #158): a
//! dynamic root item under one of its commands, a timer, a folder watcher
//! or a run-time provision, each a handle the extension owns. Dropping
//! the handle undoes it; so does the instance holding it going away, and
//! the generation ending — a disable, a reload, an update, an uninstall
//! or a pause — so an author never writes cleanup code. Nothing here
//! changes a package's `pane.json` beyond opting into the activation
//! entry point (`"activate"`, [`crate::lifecycle`]), which Pane calls
//! when the package's code may run, so registrations are made without
//! waiting for the user.
//!
//! A [`Timer`]` fires by calling a closure Pane hands the event export
//! ([`export!`](Self::export) below): `every(5, || async { ... })`
//! registers a timer that fires every five seconds. A [`Watcher`] reports
//! a folder's changes the same way, coalesced. A dynamic root item is
//! [`Item`]s in the item shape of docs/list-tree.md, whose actions are
//! repeatable closures, delivered as the command's actions are; one that
//! declares a [`Mode`](Item::mode) is a **dynamic command**, launched as
//! its command is with a launch record naming the item's id. A
//! [`Provision`] provides a capability the package's `pane.json` marks
//! `atRunTime`, only while this is held.
//!
//! Every registration is refused, with the reason, when it is beyond
//! Pane's limits (1000 dynamic root items, 64 timers, 16 watchers and 16
//! provisions for one package), when a timer's interval is not between
//! 1 second and 30 days, when a watcher's path cannot be watched, when a
//! provision is not declared and marked, and when this code of the
//! extension was replaced — using a handle after a reload fails the same
//! way.
