//! Pane's settings sample: a command whose choice Pane keeps between runs.
//! The chosen greeting style is saved with [`pane_guest::settings`], so it
//! survives restarting Pane and disabling and re-enabling the package. It also
//! keeps one value of each other kind of data: a note ([`content`]), the last
//! greeting ([`cache`]) and a sign-in token ([`credentials`]), so clearing its
//! cache in Manage extensions shows what is removed and what is kept.
//! "Save after waiting" shows a call Pane stops: it notes in its settings
//! that it started, waits ten seconds, then notes that it finished; disabling
//! or reloading the package meanwhile stops it, so it never finishes.
//! "Crash" crashes on purpose (a panic traps the guest): three crashes in a
//! row pause the package until the user retries it, keeping its data.
//! "Count" adds one to a count kept in its content and answers the new
//! count: an action whose effect is done once it has run. If its answer is
//! lost (Pane's runtime crashed before answering), Pane does not run it
//! again by itself, so the count never grows without the user asking.
