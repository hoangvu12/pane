//! Package search, the online search sample: a command whose screen is a
//! designed List that handles its search itself (#240) — the search field
//! Pane draws in the header, its text told to the view through the
//! List's search-text event, throttled, and the service's answers listed
//! as the items. Pane asks the service nothing while the user types in
//! root search: the field is the view's own, not root search's.
//!
//! The service is the fixture service, a made-up package registry on this
//! computer (`cargo run -p pane-core --example fixture_service`, port
//! 8740 by default; `crates/pane-core/tests/support/service.rs`). The
//! command reaches it through `wasi:http` with [`pane_extension::http::get`]
//! and reads its JSON with `serde_json`, an ordinary `no_std` library. Its
//! address is a setting the "Service address" item's pushed view changes
//! (a text field and a Save button, the modern replacement for the typed
//! form the List document carried), so the same sample works against a
//! service on another port.
//!
//! A search starts in the render that answers the text (the `Pending`
//! pattern, #243): the loading state shows while it runs, and the results
//! are drawn the moment they land. An unreachable or failing service is an
//! error shown in place of results, not a crash, so it never pauses the
//! extension. Activating a result fetches that package's details and shows
//! them in a toast. Items, toasts and errors match the JavaScript and
//! TypeScript samples.
