//! Pane's Switch Windows, a default extension (ADR 0040): a command
//! listing the windows Alt+Tab would show, so the user finds a window by
//! typing — its title, its application's name and icon — and switches to
//! it with Enter. The host lists the windows (`pane_extension::windows`)
//! in z-order with the front application's first, so switching back to
//! what the user was in before opening Pane is one keystroke; typing
//! filters by title and application name, as the command's search. Enter
//! brings the chosen window to the front, restoring it if it is
//! minimized, and a window that closed says so. Window actions (close,
//! minimize, maximize, restore, keep on top) are a later slice.
