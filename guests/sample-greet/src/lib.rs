//! Pane's greet capability provider sample in Rust. Its package provides
//! the capability `pane-samples:greet@1` (under `provides` in its
//! pane.json), served by [`publish::Guest::run_operation`] through the same
//! export that serves published operations; its command only says what it
//! provides. The JavaScript and TypeScript samples (guests/sample-greet-js
//! and guests/sample-greet-ts) provide the same capability, each answering
//! with its own language's name, so a consumer installed with any of them
//! works without naming any of them.
//!
//! The capability's `greet` operation takes `{"name": "<name>"}` and answers
//! `{"greeting": "Hello, <name>, from Rust"}`, or the error "a name is
//! needed". Pane calls it with the operation qualified by its capability —
//! `pane-samples:greet@1/greet` — so one component can tell a capability
//! call from a call by identity to an operation of the same name; nothing
//! else is served.
