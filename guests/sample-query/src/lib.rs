//! A command that takes a query, the smallest runnable example of one:
//! Echo answers the text the user sends it from root search, through its
//! alias ("ec hello" when the user gave it the alias "ec") or by choosing it
//! as a fallback for whatever they typed. Pane sends the text only when the
//! user invokes it that way, never while they type. Opened from root search
//! like any command, it lists how to use it.
