// Pane's handoff sample in TypeScript: a command that keeps a counter and
// a draft in memory and opts in to handing them to its new code (ADR 0041,
// #159), so a Reload, an Update or a development-mode reload finds them
// where it left them — and its screen, which Pane opens again either way,
// with the launch record it was opened with. "Add one" counts; "Edit the
// draft" opens the draft's form, whose text it saves. Nothing is written
// to Pane's extension data: without the handoff, a replacement loses both.
// The state is a value this module versions itself, which
// `@pane-app/extension/state` serialises. Items, titles and answers match
// the Rust and JavaScript handoff samples.
