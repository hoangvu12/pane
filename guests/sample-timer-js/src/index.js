// Pane's timer sample in JavaScript: a clock whose screen changes by
// itself — the view's tree asks Pane to render it again after every
// second (`refresh-after-ms`, #236) — with its caption arriving as pending
// data shown first as a loading state (`usePending`). The behaviour
// matches the Rust and TypeScript samples (sample-timer,
// sample-timer-ts): the same texts, the same timings.
//
// The view is written as elements (the JSX runtime's `jsxs`), which is
// what JSX compiles to (the TypeScript sample); the components and hooks
// come from `@pane-app/extension/view`.
