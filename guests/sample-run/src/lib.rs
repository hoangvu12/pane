//! Pane's Run sample: a command that runs what Windows' Run dialog (Win+R)
//! runs through `pane_extension::run`, sharing the Run dialog's own
//! history. It answers the same in JavaScript and TypeScript
//! (guests/sample-run-js, guests/sample-run-ts), so the tests drive all
//! three alike.
//!
//! - "Run sample" is a no-view command that takes a query: the command
//!   line it is sent from root search, through its alias or as a
//!   fallback, runs; a toast says what ran.
//! - "Run elevated" runs the command line it is sent through Windows'
//!   own elevation prompt, which the user may decline.
//! - "Run in Terminal" runs the command line it is sent where console
//!   tools stay open to be read: in a new Windows Terminal tab when it is
//!   installed, otherwise in the shell's own window, with the shell the
//!   package's preference chooses.
//! - "Run with Completions" opens a screen whose search field holds the
//!   command line, completed as it is typed from the Run dialog's
//!   history, programs, applets, consoles, schemes and variables; the
//!   first row runs the text as typed, Enter on a completion runs its
//!   line.
//! - "Run history" lists the shared history, newest first: Enter runs an
//!   entry again, and Delete removes it from the history.
