//! Pane's application launcher, a default extension: the applications
//! installed on the system are found by name in root search, each its own
//! result, and invoking one opens it. Pane's host finds and opens them
//! ([`pane_extension::applications`]), since a WASI guest cannot; this
//! extension supplies them to root search, so disabling the package removes
//! them and stops Pane looking for them. Its command is a root provider
//! (`"mode": "provider"` in `pane.json`, #164): it has no row and no screen
//! of its own.
