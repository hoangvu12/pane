//! Test fixture: a package that opts in to the state handoff (ADR 0041,
//! #159), whose item drives the edges the tests ask for. Tests install it
//! as many packages, each with its own pane.json; the fixture's own
//! settings say what its handoff does: the key `snapshot` whether the old
//! code answers late (`wait`) or beyond the size limit (`oversized`) —
//! `no` answers the counter — and the key `restore` whether the new code
//! rejects (`reject`) or traps on (`trap`) the state it is given — `no`
//! restores it.
//!
//! The state itself is a counter this instance keeps in memory: "Add one"
//! counts, and the command's title says where it stands, so a test sees
//! what a replacement kept and what it lost.
