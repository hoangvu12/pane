//! Test fixture: a package that registers at run time what Pane must undo
//! (#158), whose items drive the edges the tests ask for. Tests install
//! it as many packages, each with its own pane.json naming what it
//! provides (a capability, marked `atRunTime` or not) and its activation
//! entry point or none. The fixture's own settings say what its items do:
//! the key `many` how many items or timers to register beyond the limit,
//! `folder` the folder to watch, `capability` the capability to provide,
//! and `trap` whether the activation entry point traps — a trap in it is
//! a crash of the package, counted towards pausing it.
//!
//! Items: "Register the held item" registers a dynamic root item under
//! the command and keeps its handle, so later items can update and drop
//! it; "Update the held item" replaces it through the handle, answering
//! the refusal when this code of the extension was replaced; "Drop the
//! held item" drops the handle; "Register many items" and "Register many
//! timers" register as many as the settings key `many` names plus one,
//! so the last is refused with the limit named; "Register a 0-second
//! timer" and "Register a 31-day timer" are refused with the bounds;
//! "Watch the folder" watches the settings key `folder`'s path;
//! "Provide the capability" provides the settings key `capability`'s
//! name, and "Provide the undeclared capability" one no pane.json
//! declares; the timer the fixture registers fires with the tag
//! "fixture", counting into its content, so a firing is visible.
