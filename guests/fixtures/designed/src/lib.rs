//! Test fixture: a designed view whose tree and answers are JSON written
//! by hand against Pane's current contract (`wit/extension.wit`), not by
//! pane-extension, so that Pane's reading of them is checked on its own
//! (see `crates/pane-core/tests/designed_views.rs` and
//! `crates/pane-core/tests/navigation_stack.rs`).
//!
//! Its screen is a counter — a column of a text ("Count: N"), a text
//! naming how many times the view was drawn ("Renders: N", which a
//! refresh raises) and a row of the buttons below, each naming its own
//! callback id — whose presses answer what the next drawing is, once,
//! then the counter again:
//!
//! - "Increment" counts one up, and only when the event's `key` names the
//!   button, so the test checks that Pane sends the node's key;
//! - "Answer an error" makes the next `render` answer an error;
//! - "Answer an over-limit tree" makes it answer a tree of 10,001 nodes;
//! - "Draw an unknown node with a fallback" makes it answer a tree whose
//!   root is a type Pane does not know, with a `fallback` text;
//! - "Draw an unknown node without a fallback" the same without one, with
//!   a text child;
//! - "Draw a newer minor tree" a tree naming version 1.9;
//! - "Draw another major's tree" a tree naming version 2.0;
//! - "Answer an unreadable tree" makes it answer text that is not JSON;
//! - "Answer an unknown callback" answers the event itself with an error.
//!
//! The navigation stack (#239) is answered by hand too: "Push a view"
//! answers a pushed view (a text "Pushed" with the same navigation
//! buttons), "Pop with a result" pops answering "the result", and
//! "Replace this view" replaces it with a pushed view. The pop event —
//! the event with callback id 0 — is recorded and drawn ("Popped: …",
//! or "Popped" when it carried no result), so a test can see it arrive.
//!
//! The keyed state (#238) is answered by hand as well: "Draw the fields"
//! answers a tree of keyed fields — a text input with `onInput` and
//! `onChange`, a text area — and every event the view receives is
//! recorded and drawn in it ("Sent: …"), so a test can see the payloads
//! Pane sent; "Draw a tree with key problems" answers one whose keys two
//! siblings share and whose text input has none, which a developed
//! package's log reports. And the view may ask Pane to draw it again
//! itself (#243, the push channel of `pane:extension/view`): "Push a
//! render" has the next render call `ask-to-render` with the id its
//! context names — by hand, as no SDK writes it — and "Push a render,
//! answering slowly" the same with the drawing it asks for held back a
//! moment, so a test can leave the view before the drawing answers.
//!
//! Every render also answers `refresh-after-ms` as the state's
//! `refresh_ms` says, so the tests of #236 drive Pane's refreshing of a
//! view through it — each button below sets it, its presses' answers
//! asking from then on, and the hand-written values ride outside any SDK:
//!
//! - "Answer refresh 10ms" asks for 10 ms, below the 100 ms floor;
//! - "Answer refresh 25h" asks for 25 hours, above the 24 h ceiling;
//! - "Answer refresh 1s" asks for a second;
//! - "Stop refreshing" asks for none.
//!
//! It cannot use `pane-extension`, which writes the tree itself, so it
//! supplies the allocator, panic handler, byte comparisons and
//! `cabi_realloc`.
