//! Pane's System Commands, a default extension of no-view commands (ADR
//! 0037, ADR 0040): one for each session and power command the
//! `system-commands` host functions offer — Lock Screen, Log Out,
//! Restart, Shut Down, Sleep, Hibernate, Turn Off Displays and Start
//! Screen Saver — and one for each audio command — Volume Up, Volume
//! Down, Toggle Mute, Set Volume and Toggle Microphone Mute — all
//! thirteen sharing this component. A command's hotkey runs it without
//! showing Pane's window, and it answers with a HUD of the state the
//! system ended in, or why nothing changed (1.2 seconds, or 3 for the
//! failure style, ADR 0035): "Restarting", "Sleeping", "Volume 52%",
//! "Muted", "Microphones muted", "Hibernation is not available on this
//! computer: there is no hibernation file".
//!
//! Log Out, Restart and Shut Down ask first, with a destructive
//! confirmation offering "Don't ask again" (ADR 0040): a mistyped query
//! never ends a session. Restart and Shut Down then force applications
//! closed, so an application with unsaved work cannot hold one up, while
//! Log Out leaves applications the chance to save — the host's decision,
//! not this extension's; each command only calls the host function named
//! for it. Set Volume takes its level through its `level` argument (0 to
//! 100), which Pane's argument form asks for; anything else is explained
//! in the HUD, as the audio commands are not destructive and ask nothing
//! first. A background launch (a schedule) is answered with an error,
//! since no confirmation is available there: nothing happens.
//!
//! The extension declares `windows` alone in its pane.json, and only the
//! Windows default set lists it (ADR 0040).
