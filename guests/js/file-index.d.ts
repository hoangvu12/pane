// Declarations for `pane:extension/file-index` in wit/file-index.wit: the
// file index Pane keeps of the user's home folder (and the folders the user
// adds), current from the system's own change records, which a command
// searches instead of walking the disk (a WASI guest has no folders to
// read). Only a command whose package.json sets `"pane": { "fileIndex": true }`
// imports it, and its package's pane.json sets `"fileIndex": true`, so that
// Pane keeps the index current while the package is enabled. Each entry
// carries the id Pane gave it, its path, name, folder, kind, size and
// modified time; a root result or a search result names it by its id, and
// Pane checks it again before acting on it.
