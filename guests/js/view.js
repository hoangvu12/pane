// The designed view runtime: JSX elements become the nodes of the tree
// Pane renders (docs/designed-tree.md, ADR 0036), and every UI component
// of the component set — the layout primitives, the shared components,
// Markdown — is a value an author spreads into a layout. A function
// component runs per render, with the state of `useState`, `useRef` and
// `useMemo` kept per instance (by its place in the tree, and its key when
// it gives one), and Pane asks for the tree again after each event, so
// the component reads the state the event's listener changed. A view that
// changes by itself asks for that: `useInterval(ms, run)` runs `run` each
// time `ms` passes while the view is open, and `usePending(load)` presents
// data on its way as loading state (#236) — the arrival asks for a
// drawing itself (#243, `pane:extension/view`), so it is drawn the moment
// it lands, with no timer.
//
// `createView(component)` makes the view a command's `openView` answers
// with: it implements `render(context)` and `handleEvent(event)` for
// Pane's envelope, hiding the wire format and the callback ids. The ids
// name each render's listeners; the tables of the last two renders are
// kept, so a press of what the user could see is delivered even if the
// view has rendered since, and an older one is dropped. React is not
// used: its scheduler needs timers that run only inside calls.
//
// A listener may navigate (#239), returning what `push`, `replace`, `pop`
// or `Push` answer: the pushed or replacing view is a view of the same
// kind, and the `onPop` a push was given runs when the pushed view pops,
// with the result its pop answered. The back key pops a view without
// asking; its pop event carries no result. A root node's
// `navigationTitle` names the view, shown where a screen's title is.
//
// The tree is JSON with the version of the UI component set it targets;
// a Pane that renders another major refuses it naming both versions, and
// one that knows less draws what it understands.
