//! Guest-side bindings for Pane's `pane:extension` contract.
//!
//! An extension implements [`Guest`] and calls [`export!`]. It may keep
//! values between runs with [`settings`], and its own records, disposable
//! values and secrets with [`content`], [`cache`] and [`credentials`]. It
//! may compute results from root search's query with [`root`], call
//! operations other packages publish with [`operations::call`] and serve
//! those its own package publishes with [`publish`]. The crate is
//! `no_std` so the component imports only WASI 0.3 interfaces; it supplies the
//! allocator and a panic handler that traps, which the host reports as a
//! runtime error.
//!
//! Without `std` no libc is linked, so the crate also supplies what the
//! compiler and the component runtime call into libc or `std` for:
//! `memcmp` and `bcmp`, which the compiler emits for byte and string
//! comparisons (`==` on `str`, `starts_with`, ...) as soon as a guest compares
//! strings, and the canonical-ABI `cabi_realloc`.
