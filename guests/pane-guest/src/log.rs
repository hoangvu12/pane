//! Printing and logging, through `wasi:cli`'s standard output and standard
//! error. What a command writes goes to its package's extension log, which
//! its author sees while developing it ("Logs for <title>" in Pane, and the
//! development session's log file); for a package not being developed, Pane
//! keeps only its most recent lines in memory, for diagnostics.
//!
//! Use the crate's macros, as `std`'s and the `log` crate's:
//! [`debug!`](crate::debug), [`info!`](crate::info), [`warn!`](crate::warn)
//! and [`error!`](crate::error) write a line with its level;
//! [`println!`](crate::println) and [`eprintln!`](crate::eprintln) a line
//! without one (info on standard output, an error on standard error). A
//! panic's message and location are written as an error before the command
//! traps.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! pane_guest::info!("found {} items", items.len());
//! pane_guest::warn!("the service answered {status}; showing the cache");
//! ```
//!
//! Each call writes whole lines: [`print!`](crate::print) without a newline
//! still ends its line. A line longer than 4 KiB is cut, and a package
//! writing more than 1,000 lines a second loses the rest of that second.
//! Writing waits for Pane to take the line, which it does at once; it is
//! meant for a command's calls, not for a custom view's `Drop`, which may
//! not wait.
