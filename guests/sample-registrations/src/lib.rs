//! Pane's registrations sample: a command that registers at run time what
//! it owns (ADR 0041, #158) — a dynamic root item under its own command,
//! updated by a timer; a folder watcher on the folder its settings name;
//! and a provision of the `pane-samples:greet@1` capability, made after a
//! "Sign in" action and held until "Sign out" or the code's replacement.
//! The package's `pane.json` declares the activation entry point, so the
//! registrations exist as soon as Pane may run the code, without the user
//! asking; each handle lives as long as the code that made it, so a
//! disable, a reload, an update, an uninstall or a pause undoes them all,
//! and activating again makes them afresh.
//!
//! The dynamic root item counts the timer's firings and the watcher's
//! changes in the command's content, so they are visible from root search
//! and survive a replacement of the code; its own action "Add one" adds
//! to the count, as an action of a registered item is repeatable. The
//! watcher's changes are coalesced by Pane; the item's title says how
//! many there have been. "Sign in" provides the capability: the
//! capabilities sample, which uses `pane-samples:greet@1` from every
//! provider, lists this package's answer while the provision is held and
//! not while it is dropped. Items, titles, results and errors match the
//! JavaScript and TypeScript registrations samples.
