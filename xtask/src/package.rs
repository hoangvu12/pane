//! Building Pane's packages and the artifacts its own updates are
//! downloaded from (#53 for Linux, #51 for Windows, #52 for macOS).
//!
//! `package-linux`, `package-windows` and `package-macos` each produce,
//! under `target/dist/`:
//!
//! - `pane-<version>-<os>-<arch>[-dev].tar.gz` (Linux) or `.zip`
//!   (Windows and macOS) — the package a clean machine of that system
//!   installs from: the `pane` program, the install script and a README
//!   (and, on Linux, a desktop entry, on macOS the `Info.plist` of the
//!   `Pane.app` bundle the install script makes), and none of the default
//!   extensions (internet-first: Pane fetches them at first setup, from
//!   the commits this release pins). A `.sha256` file beside it names its
//!   digest; nothing is signed, since no signing credentials exist yet.
//! - `artifacts/` — what an artifact source serves: the index document
//!   `pane-defaults.json`, naming the application package a Pane
//!   application update downloads, and the package itself. A real
//!   deployment serves this folder at Pane's published downloads; the
//!   tests and smokes serve it from this computer
//!   (`scripts/artifact_server.py`) instead, so no check reaches the
//!   network.
//!
//! `--dev` builds the package's program in the development profile: the
//! native smokes install that one, because only a development build takes
//! its artifact source from `PANE_ARTIFACTS` and its default extensions'
//! pins from `PANE_DEFAULTS` (a release build uses Pane's published
//! downloads and the committed pins, which no controlled source may
//! replace). Without it, the release profile is built.
//!
//! The index the artifacts hold names the application package a Pane
//! application update downloads (#54): its `application` entry, with the
//! package's version, file name, sha512 integrity, size and target.
//! `--package-version <version>` builds the program reporting that
//! version and names the package and its entry by it — for the smokes,
//! which need a newer version to offer than the one installed (a real
//! release builds the workspace's own version, and no override is
//! given).
//!
//! Each task builds the package for the system it runs on, so a release
//! for several systems builds one package per system (this machine builds
//! the Linux one, CI's `windows-2025`, `macos-15` and `ubuntu-24.04`
//! runners theirs). `package-windows` and `package-macos` run everywhere
//! far enough to assemble the artifacts, then refuse anywhere but their
//! own system: `pane.exe` needs a Windows build and the `pane` program a
//! macOS one (no cross toolchain is set up), and packing another system's
//! program under that system's package name would be worse than
//! explaining so.

WHAT THIS IS

  Pane, a desktop launcher. This package holds the pane program and
  installs it for one user; it holds none of Pane's default extensions:
  Pane downloads them itself the first time it runs, from Pane's own
  downloads (https://downloads.pane.sh/).

PREREQUISITES

  A 64-bit Linux with X11, and these libraries (Ubuntu 24.04 package
  names; the install script checks what is missing):

    libxkbcommon0 libxkbcommon-x11-0 libwayland-client0 libxcb1
    libfontconfig1 libfreetype6 libvulkan1

  plus a Vulkan driver; Mesa's mesa-vulkan-drivers works without a GPU.

INSTALL

  bash install.sh            # installs to ~/.local
  bash install.sh --prefix X # installs to X instead

  It copies the pane program to <prefix>/bin and a desktop entry to
  <prefix>/share/applications, and runs `pane --version` to check what it
  installed. No root is needed.

UNINSTALL

  Remove <prefix>/bin/pane and <prefix>/share/applications/pane.desktop.
  Pane keeps its own data in ~/.local/share/pane (its installed
  extensions and their settings); remove that folder to remove them too.

FIRST RUN

  The first run downloads Pane's default extensions (the calculator) from
  https://downloads.pane.sh/ and shows their progress; Pane stays usable
  if the download fails, and offers to try again. That location is not
  deployed yet, so today a first run on the real internet explains that
  it cannot reach it and keeps everything else working.

  NOTHING IS SIGNED

  The package is not signed: no signing credentials exist. Its sha256 is
  in the pane-<version>-linux-<arch>.tar.gz.sha256 file beside it, which
  says only what was packed.

  Pane downloads them itself the first time it runs, from Pane's own

PREREQUISITES

  A 64-bit x86_64 Windows. The system this package was built and checked

  compiler, and no administrator rights.

INSTALL

  Unzip this package (Explorer unzips it, or Expand-Archive in
  PowerShell), then, in the pane folder it unpacked:

    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File install.ps1

  It copies the pane.exe program to %LOCALAPPDATA%\Pane, puts a Pane
  shortcut in your Start menu, and runs `pane --version` to check what it
  installed. No administrator rights are needed. To install somewhere
  else, add -InstallDir <folder>; to install from another folder, add
  -PackageFolder <folder>.

  PowerShell may refuse install.ps1 as a script that came from the
  internet (nothing here is signed): the -ExecutionPolicy Bypass above
  answers that, or run Unblock-File install.ps1 once. Check the package's
  digest against the pane-<version>-windows-<arch>.zip.sha256 file beside
  it if it reached you over the internet.

UNINSTALL

  Remove %LOCALAPPDATA%\Pane\pane.exe and the Pane shortcut in your Start
  menu (close Pane first). Pane keeps its own data in
  %LOCALAPPDATA%\Pane\data (its installed extensions and their settings);
  remove that folder to remove them too.

FIRST RUN

  The first run downloads Pane's default extensions (the calculator) from
  https://downloads.pane.sh/ and shows their progress; Pane stays usable
  if the download fails, and offers to try again. That location is not
  deployed yet, so today a first run on the real internet explains that
  it cannot reach it and keeps everything else working.

  NOTHING IS SIGNED

  The package is not signed: no signing credentials exist (no
  Authenticode certificate), so Windows may warn about an unknown
  publisher when the program or the install script runs. Its sha256 is in
  the pane-<version>-windows-<arch>.zip.sha256 file beside it, which says
  only what was packed."#

WHAT THIS IS

  Pane, a desktop launcher. This package holds the pane program and
  installs it, as a Pane.app bundle, for one user; it holds none of
  Pane's default extensions: Pane downloads them itself the first time
  it runs, from Pane's own downloads (https://downloads.pane.sh/).

PREREQUISITES

  macOS 15 on Apple silicon (arm64): the system this package was built
  and checked on (CI's macos-15 runner); no other macOS or Mac has been
  tried. Nothing else is needed: no Node, Rust, npm, Git or compiler,
  and no administrator rights.

INSTALL

  Unzip this package (Finder opens a zip with a double-click, or unzip
  in the terminal), then, in the pane folder it unpacked:

    bash install.sh            # installs to ~/Applications
    bash install.sh --app-dir X # installs Pane.app into X instead

  It builds the Pane.app bundle in ~/Applications — a folder of your
  own, so no administrator rights are needed — around the pane program
  and this package's Info.plist, and runs `pane --version` to check
  what it installed. Open Pane with a double-click in Finder, or:

    open ~/Applications/Pane.app

  Nothing is signed (no Apple Developer credentials exist). macOS only
  checks Gatekeeper on files that carry its quarantine mark, which the
  web browser or mail program that downloaded this package set: its
  first Pane.app will be blocked as an app macOS cannot check, and you
  allow it in System Settings (Privacy & Security). A package built on
  your own machine, like a CI runner's, carries no mark and runs at
  once. Check the package's digest against the
  pane-<version>-macos-<arch>.zip.sha256 file beside it if it reached
  you over the internet.

UNINSTALL

  Remove ~/Applications/Pane.app (close Pane first). Pane keeps its own
  data in ~/Library/Application Support/Pane (its installed extensions
  and their settings) and its caches in ~/Library/Caches/Pane; remove
  those folders to remove them too.

FIRST RUN

  The first run downloads Pane's default extensions (the calculator)
  from https://downloads.pane.sh/ and shows their progress; Pane stays
  usable if the download fails, and offers to try again. That location
  is not deployed yet, so today a first run on the real internet
  explains that it cannot reach it and keeps everything else working.

  NOTHING IS SIGNED

  The package is not signed: no signing credentials exist (no Apple
  Developer ID certificate, and nothing is notarized). Its sha256 is in
  the pane-<version>-macos-<arch>.zip.sha256 file beside it, which says
  only what was packed."#
