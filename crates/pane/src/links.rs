//! The system's handlers for web links and files, which open quicklinks and
//! other `open-url` results, and the files of `open-file` results, with the
//! commands the `open` crate names for this system: `/usr/bin/open` on
//! macOS; PowerShell's `Start-Process` (then `explorer.exe`) on Windows;
//! `xdg-open` (then `gio`, `gnome-open`, `kde-open`) on Linux. None runs
//! through a shell, and the Windows opener passes the target to PowerShell
//! in an environment variable, not on its command line.
//!
//! A handler that is still running after [`SETTLE`] counts as having opened
//! the link or file: `xdg-open` outside a desktop session runs the program
//! itself and returns only when it exits, so waiting for it would leave Pane
//! "running" as long as the browser or viewer is open.
