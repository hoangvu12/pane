//! The launcher's background image (ADR 0028): Pane's own copy of the
//! picture the user chose, and the backdrop baked from it that the
//! launcher draws behind its content.
//!
//! [`import`] keeps the copy: the chosen file is decoded (so a file that is
//! not a picture is refused before anything is kept), scaled down to at
//! most 1920 on its longer side and written as a JPEG into the data
//! folder's `backgrounds` folder under a fresh name, which is what the
//! settings record names. The user's own file is never read again, so
//! moving or deleting it changes nothing. [`prune`] removes the copies no
//! record or choice names any more.
//!
//! [`bake`] makes the backdrop: GPUI CE draws images but has no image
//! masks, so the whole look the background mockup settled on
//! (`docs/research/background-mockup`, the "Hero" preset) is composited here,
//! on the CPU, into one opaque frame at the launcher panel's size in
//! physical pixels — the picture cover-fitted into the panel, the chosen
//! [`BackgroundEffect`], a blurred copy beneath a sharp one that gives way
//! below the middle, the fade to the canvas and the dim over it all. The
//! canvas is the panel's own color moved toward the picture's dominant
//! color (Roboco's `wallpaper_colors::extract`) and kept dark (or light)
//! enough for the palette's text; the launcher paints its panel with it,
//! and the frame has faded all but entirely into it by its lower edge, so
//! the two meet without a seam.
//!
//! The effects are Roboco's new-thread background treatments
//! (`roboco/crates/ui/src/new_thread_background_effects.rs`), drawn at the
//! frame's own pixels: their cells (the dither's dots, the glyphs, the
//! halftone's cells) are logical pixels, so a scaled display draws them
//! the size a standard one does.
//!
//! Everything here is blocking work for the background executor.
