//! The Settings window's Keyboard page: the bounded set of in-app
//! navigation actions, each with its binding, rebindable here.
//!
//! The actions are Pane's own — previous/next result, invoke selected
//! action, back, return to root, dismiss launcher and open Settings —
//! never an extension's and never the text-editing keys a focused field
//! owns (see [`pane_core::keyboard`], the renderer-independent set and
//! its rules). Their bindings live in the host settings, so a change
//! takes effect in every window at once and survives a restart.
//!
//! The recorder is the General page's, per action: a row whose click (or
//! Enter, while it is not listening) starts listening, and whose keys,
//! while it listens, are the binding being recorded — captured without
//! acting, so neither the sidebar's navigation nor the window's
//! traversal moves, and never the action being rebound. Escape cancels;
//! Enter and Space cannot be part of a binding, being the recorder's own
//! activation, so they are the defaults' privilege and a reset's to
//! restore. A captured combination is checked — protected for a focused
//! field, and against the other actions of the set, whose contexts
//! overlap in the launcher's window — applied through the host settings
//! (which re-make the keymap before saving), and then saved; a refusal
//! is explained beside the row and keeps the recorder listening.
//!
//! Per action, a reset row appears whenever its binding is not the
//! default: pointer-only, like the General page's, so recovery from a
//! binding that does not suit the keyboard in front of the user never
//! needs the very keys being rebound. A reset goes through the same
//! checks as a recording, so it cannot land on another action's keys.
