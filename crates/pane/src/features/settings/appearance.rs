//! The Appearance section of the General page: the theme and material
//! choices (#98), as two rows of segmented choices, and the launcher's
//! background image (ADR 0028) — a row to choose, change or remove the
//! picture, and its effect as a third row of segments.
//!
//! Every value it shows and every choice it takes goes through the host
//! settings ([`crate::settings`]) — the one entity the launcher window and
//! the Settings window both observe — so a choice made here repaints both
//! windows at once, without a restart, and is written to the record off
//! the window's thread. What the section itself owns is presentation only:
//! the rows and the honesty notes (glass's platform fallback, an override
//! in force, a save that failed).
//!
//! It offers only the settings Pane has (#100): the theme (System, Light,
//! Dark), the material (Glass and Solid) and the background image with
//! its effect (None, Dither, ASCII, Halftone, Scanlines — Roboco's
//! new-thread background treatments). The picture is chosen with the
//! platform's file picker; the host settings keep their own copy of it.
//! The development overrides do not touch the background image, and its
//! effect waits for a picture. The board's accent swatches,
//! blur and tint sliders, density, toggles and preview are not Pane's; the
//! visual workbench's reference fixture draws them to measure the shared
//! controls against the board.
//!
//! The material's segments carry the *preference*; where the platform
//! cannot provide glass, the material row says so, and the windows render
//! the solid surface.
//!
//! The segments are the keyboard's too: each is a tab stop, and Enter or
//! Space chooses it as a click does, under Pane's focus ring (the board
//! draws none). While an override is in force they are drawn at the
//! board's disabled opacity, and neither take the keyboard nor answer a
//! click.
