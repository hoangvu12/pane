//! The Settings window's Shortcuts page: the installed commands grouped
//! by their extensions, searchable, each with its Name, Alias and Hotkey.
//!
//! The page is a renderer over [`Launcher::shortcut_catalog`] — one read
//! of the same records Manage extensions shows — rebuilt on every redraw:
//! a package installed, disabled, enabled, updated or removed, in the
//! launcher window or in the background, is in the next catalog the page
//! draws. The window's watcher (see the Settings window's module docs) is
//! what asks for that redraw while the user does nothing here.
//!
//! The Alias column is editable inline: activating a command's alias cell
//! opens a field in its place, filled with the current alias, that commits
//! with Enter and cancels with Escape. Commits apply through
//! [`Launcher::set_alias`], so the alias form's rules and records are the
//! ones in force: a refusal shows next to the field and keeps the editor
//! open, and the change reaches root search at once and is recorded by
//! the same write the form's submission makes. The Hotkey column records
//! through [`Launcher::set_hotkey`] — the same checks and the same
//! `hotkeys.json` the hotkey screen in Manage extensions writes: the
//! cell's click, Enter or Space starts the recorder, which takes the keys
//! pressed next as the binding being recorded (captured: they do not
//! navigate or act; Escape cancels, changing nothing), and a Clear button
//! beside the cell forgets a recorded hotkey. A refusal shows under the
//! cell and keeps the recorder listening; a change that lands is
//! registered with the system before the binding it replaces is released,
//! and a record that cannot be written puts back what was last recorded,
//! with its registration, as the status line says.
//!
//! Keyboard: the filter field, each group's header (Enter or Space
//! expands or collapses it), each editable alias cell, each recordable
//! hotkey cell and its Clear button are tab stops. The editor's Enter and
//! Escape are bound in its own key context, and the recorder's keys in
//! its own, so they reach those controls and nothing else.
//!
//! Groups disclose on the shared motion policy (see `crate::ui::motion`):
//! one tween per group drives both the header chevron's rotation and the
//! commands' arrival, so the two coordinate on one timeline and retarget
//! together when the user reverses mid-flight. Expanding mounts the rows
//! at once — the real layout, hit targets and all — and fades the whole
//! block in; collapsing unmounts them at once, never drawing the
//! departing rows fading out, while the chevron turns back. Focus inside
//! a collapsing group moves to its controlling header, an open editor in
//! it closes without committing, and a hotkey recorder for one of its
//! commands ends, as Escape ends it. Typing in the filter is a
//! content update: rows appear and vanish with no transition at all.
