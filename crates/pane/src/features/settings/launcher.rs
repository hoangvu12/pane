//! The Launcher page: the choices that govern the launcher window — which
//! display it opens on, and what reopening it starts from.
//!
//! Every value it shows and every choice it takes goes through the host
//! settings ([`crate::settings`]), so the record's own rules — atomic
//! writes, an unreadable record never replaced, a failed save reported
//! with the shown choice rolled back — are the ones these choices live
//! by. Neither choice changes what the windows render, so choosing here
//! repaints nothing: the opening display is resolved against the display
//! layout every time the launcher opens (through [`crate::placement`],
//! the platform seam this page also reads to explain the choices), and
//! what reopening shows is applied when the launcher is next opened.
//!
//! The opening monitor is the Pane-styled searchable select
//! ([`crate::ui::select`]): the first real consumer of the shared
//! control, whose choices are few but whose search and keywords the
//! control needs exercised. The reopening choices keep the direct
//! choice rows — two fixed rows a user scans faster than searches, the
//! control's own rule for when a searchable select is warranted.
//!
//! What the page explains, as the General page does for its hotkey: the
//! choices the platform cannot answer — the pointer's display where the
//! system does not tell Pane where the pointer is, the active window's
//! display where it does not tell Pane which window is active — are
//! shown with their reason and not offered, rather than pretending they
//! succeeded; a platform that cannot choose the launcher's display at
//! all (Wayland) explains that instead; and a choice whose display is
//! disconnected falls back to the primary display, which the page says.
//! The dismissal behavior is the specification's Escape contract, not a
//! choice: backing out of what is open — a composition, a menu, a screen
//! — comes first, and hiding the launcher never quits Pane.
