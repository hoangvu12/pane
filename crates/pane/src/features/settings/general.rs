//! The General page: the choices that govern Pane as a whole — today,
//! the Open Pane hotkey, whether Pane starts at login, and whether Pane
//! shows its tray or menu-bar entry.
//!
//! The Open Pane hotkey is the application-owned global binding that
//! summons the launcher from any application, recorded here and applied
//! through the platform's global-shortcut registration. The binding is
//! Pane's own, not any extension's: the record it is kept in is the host
//! settings' (`settings.json`, whose rules the entity in
//! `crate::settings` keeps), it is registered through the launcher this
//! window shares with the launcher window, and it stays registered while
//! every extension is disabled and while the extension runtime has
//! failed — nothing of its lifecycle belongs to a package.
//!
//! The recorder captures keys without executing them. While it listens,
//! its row holds focus and its key context swallows the keys that would
//! otherwise act (the sidebar's navigation, Tab's traversal), so a
//! captured combination records instead of navigating; Escape cancels
//! recording, changing nothing. A captured combination is checked —
//! against the combinations the system keeps for itself (the Windows key,
//! Spotlight, the window menu — never taken over silently) and against
//! the command hotkeys — and registered *before* the binding it replaces
//! is released, so a refusal, a cancellation, a reset that cannot be
//! applied or a save that fails never discards the previous working
//! binding. Reset goes back to the provisional default through the same
//! checks as recording.
//!
//! The launch-at-login choice is the same discipline with one more
//! party: the platform's own registration, reached through the
//! [`pane_core::autostart`] adapter the entity holds. The choice, the
//! registration and the platform's ability are three different truths,
//! and the page shows all three rather than one pretense. The switch
//! carries the user's *saved preference*; the note under it carries what
//! the platform actually holds or why the last change failed (a
//! registration that still awaits macOS's approval, a system that
//! refused, the freedesktop convention's limit on Linux); and where the
//! integration cannot manage a registration here at all — an unsupported
//! platform, a development build — the switch is not offered, and the
//! reason is shown instead. A failed registration, removal or save is
//! the page's status, never a switch that pretends it succeeded. Every
//! value shown and every choice taken goes through the host settings
//! ([`crate::settings`]), so the record's own rules (atomic writes, an
//! unreadable record never replaced) are the ones this choice lives by.
//!
//! The tray or menu-bar visibility is the third of the same discipline:
//! the native entry is shown or hidden through the platform's adapter
//! before the choice is kept, so only a change that took is saved, a
//! system that refused explains itself, and a platform with no entry at
//! all (Linux today) explains that instead of offering a switch that
//! would pretend. The entry is the one place outside Pane's own windows
//! whose menu opens the launcher, Settings and Quit — so hiding it
//! leaves the launcher's footer menu, its Settings root result and the
//! local Settings shortcut as the entry points they always were, and
//! hiding it never hides a window: a launcher whose Open Pane binding
//! failed keeps its window, because the entry is the only thing the
//! preference ever hides.
//!
//! What the page explains: the binding's state — why a chosen one is not
//! registered, including the Wayland limitation and the desktop-shortcut
//! guidance the adapter itself carries — the reason a recording was
//! refused, and what a save reported. A binding that could not be
//! registered at startup keeps the entry itself visible and honest
//! rather than hiding the only window that can fix it.
