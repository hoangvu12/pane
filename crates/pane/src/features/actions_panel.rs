//! The contextual Actions panel: the reference's searchable menu of what
//! can be done with root search's selected result, opened over the footer
//! by its Actions button or the Open actions binding (Ctrl+K by default).
//!
//! What it lists is the core's ([`pane_core::Launcher::result_actions`]):
//! the result's primary action — the footer's, the same dispatch — then,
//! for an installed command, its hotkey and alias configuration. Nothing
//! is listed without a working operation behind it (#100).
//!
//! The panel holds its target: the row selected when it opened, by its
//! stable id. While it is open the pointer cannot move root search's
//! selection, and an entry runs only if the core still has that target
//! selected with that action ready — a result removed or disabled behind
//! the panel shows its entries unavailable and runs nothing.
//!
//! Its search field holds focus: typing filters the entries by label, the
//! arrows move the selection over what is listed, Enter runs it, a click
//! runs the entry clicked, and Escape (or Tab) closes the panel only,
//! giving focus back to the query field. A mouse-down outside the panel
//! closes it and is consumed, so the result it covered is never invoked.
//! The panel opens and closes at once: the reference authors no motion
//! for it.
