//! Launcher placement: the display the launcher window opens on, as the
//! Launcher page's choice resolves against the display layout the platform
//! reports.
//!
//! The choice is a host setting (the record's `openingMonitor` field); the
//! behavior half that is the same everywhere — the resolution, with its
//! fallbacks — is [`pane_core::placement`]. What this module owns is the
//! platform half: the layout, read from the system's own display list, and
//! the move of a window that already exists, which GPUI CE has no API for
//! (it places a window once, when the window is made). One small trait,
//! [`Placement`], with one adapter per system, chosen by [`native`]:
//!
//! - Windows: the monitors the GDI API lists, each with its bounds and its
//!   work area, the primary one, the pointer's position from `GetCursorPos`
//!   and the foreground window's monitor from `MonitorFromWindow`; moving
//!   a window is `SetWindowPos` on the window's handle ([`windows`]);
//! - macOS: the displays CoreGraphics lists with their bounds in points,
//!   the main one, and the pointer's position from a fresh event; the
//!   display of the active window is not told — macOS shows no window of
//!   another application without a permission Pane does not ask for — so
//!   that choice is explained, not offered. Moving a window is
//!   `setFrameTopLeftPoint` on the AppKit window behind the view
//!   ([`macos`]);
//! - Linux on X11: the monitors RandR lists, the pointer's position from
//!   the root window, and the active window's monitor from the window
//!   manager's `_NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW`; moving a window is a configure
//!   request ([`x11`]). Wayland places windows itself, so there the whole
//!   choice is explained rather than offered.
//!
//! The tests replace the adapter through [`init`], with a layout they
//! choose and a record of every move they were asked for, so the placement
//! is exercised at the same boundary a user sees it — the window's
//! opening — without owning the machine's real displays.
//!
//! [`windows`]: self::windows
//! [`macos`]: self::macos
//! [`x11`]: self::x11
