//! The Windows reference/native comparison workbench's native fixture (#91).
//!
//! This is the mechanism every visual ticket of the UI port (#90) uses: a
//! window that renders Pane's **production** GPUI components — the result
//! row, the keycap, the search header, the L1 panel and footer surfaces,
//! the footer action button — at the authored reference's client size,
//! with fixture data copied from the reference board, in named states a
//! capture helper drives. It is not a second UI: every visual value comes
//! from the same [`Theme`] tokens the launcher renders with, and the
//! components are the same functions the launcher calls. The composition
//! glue around them (which rows, which state, which keycaps) is this
//! harness's own, because the workbench owns scenario state, not the
//! launcher.
//!
//! The scenarios are the registration seam: a registry of [`Scenario`]s —
//! each a name, the client size it renders at, the rows it shows and the
//! [`Step`]s that drive it — that this ticket starts with the root/result
//! and keycap families. Later tickets register their own scenarios (the
//! contextual Actions panel, the calculator card, the clipboard split
//! view, the Appearance controls) by appending to [`scenarios`];
//! [`pending_scenarios`] records the reference boards whose native
//! scenarios do not exist yet, each with the ticket that will add them, so
//! the workbench reports them as pending rather than silently passing
//! them by (none is left since the Appearance page, #98). Store and the
//! snap HUD stay source-only fixture references: their boards are
//! catalogued in the research, and no production or fixture
//! implementation is planned for them in this milestone.
//!
//! The steps are the one description of a scenario both capture helpers
//! follow — the native one against this window, the reference one against
//! the authored board — and [`replay`] replays them over the
//! fixture's own state model, so the manifest declares, for every capture,
//! which rows show, which is selected, which the pointer is over and where
//! each one lies. The comparison then validates each side against its own
//! declaration before comparing the sides with each other.
//!
//! What the fixture is **not**: it is not a parity test by itself. The
//! comparison that proves 1:1 fidelity lives in the workbench's scripts
//! (`scripts/visual-workbench/`). The fixture also never touches the
//! user's data: the runner gives it its own temporary data directory, it
//! loads no extensions and reads no installed commands, and the fixture
//! rows below are presentation values only — they never become the user's
//! installed-app list. The real launcher's own wiring is guarded
//! separately, by
//! `the_production_scenario_edits_searches_selects_opens_and_back_navigates`
//! in the window integration tests: fixture matching cannot hide a missing
//! production path.
