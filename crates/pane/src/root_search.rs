//! Root search's query field and its results, also used as the search field
//! of an opened command that searches as the user types.
//!
//! The query field is GPUI CE's single-line editable text element (typing,
//! editing keys, clipboard, undo and input-method composition). It has
//! keyboard focus whenever root search, or a command's search, is on screen;
//! every change searches at once (the launcher decides what: root search's
//! providers, or only the opened command). Up and Down move the selection
//! through the results instead of the caret, Enter opens the selected result
//! and Escape clears the query.
//!
//! The field's editing keys are the ones the form's text fields use, bound
//! once by [`crate::form::bind_text_editing`] without Tab, Enter and
//! Escape: those bubble from the field to the launcher's Confirm and Back
//! actions. [`bind_keys`] takes that binding's result, so root search cannot
//! be registered without it.
//!
//! For assistive technology the field and the result list form one
//! `EditableComboBox` node, which tracks the field's focus and carries the
//! query as its value; the selected result is its active descendant, so it
//! is reported as focused, and with no result the combo box itself is.
