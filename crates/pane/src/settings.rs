//! Pane's host settings: the appearance preferences and the Open Pane
//! hotkey the application owns, held as one observable entity every window
//! renders through.
//!
//! [`init`] reads the record — `settings.json` in Pane's data folder, kept
//! by [`pane_core::HostSettings`] under the house record rules — applies
//! the development overrides `PANE_THEME` and `PANE_MATERIAL`, and makes
//! the entity the app's global. [`shared`] hands it to whichever code
//! holds an [`App`], and [`visuals`] reads what every window renders with:
//! the theme and material the preferences resolve to, the system's
//! appearance included where the preference follows it.
//!
//! The entity is *observable*: both windows — the launcher's and
//! Settings' — register, in their constructors, an observer that repaints
//! the window and re-applies its background when the settings change, so
//! one choice updates both at once with no restart. The same observers
//! feed the system's appearance changes back into the entity, so a
//! "follow the system" theme re-renders when the operating system switches
//! between light and dark (GPUI delivers the platform's notification on
//! every supported platform; the test platform simulates it).
//!
//! Persistence follows the record's own discipline. A choice takes effect
//! in both windows immediately and is then written off the window's
//! thread, one write at a time, each holding the choices as they are when
//! it begins, so rapid changes converge on the last of them. A write that
//! fails is reported (the appearance page shows it as its status) and the
//! displayed choice goes back to what the record last held, so what the
//! page shows is what Pane actually saved — the saved preference and the
//! effective state stay distinguishable, and a fresh start reloads the
//! last successfully saved choice. The Open Pane hotkey follows the same
//! rule with one more step: it is registered with the system *before* it
//! is kept, and a write that fails also releases the registration the
//! record does not hold, so what the record names is what works. A record
//! that cannot be read is never replaced: the choice is refused, the
//! reason is reported, and the source data stays on disk for diagnosis.
//!
//! The development overrides are a separate matter: they win for this
//! process — the record is not consulted for what the windows render —
//! but they are never written back as the user's preference, and the
//! appearance page says they are in force. [`ensure`] is the fallback for
//! windows built without a startup step (the tests'): an in-memory entity
//! with the product defaults and nowhere to save, and no environment
//! overrides, so those windows render deterministically.
//!
//! What this module does not do: it makes no palette or surface decision
//! of its own. [`crate::ui::Visuals`] stays presentation — this module
//! resolves the preferences into it, including the platform's
//! normalization of a glass request to the solid surface, and the page
//! explains that.
