//! The canvas: a leaf the extension draws into (#242, the custom view's
//! successor). Its drawing operations — paths with fills and strokes,
//! rectangles and circles, text and images, clip and transform — paint
//! through GPUI's [`canvas`] and the path builder, never one element per
//! shape: a run of shape operations between text and image ones is one
//! GPUI canvas, so the order the tree paints them in is kept, and a
//! picker of twenty swatches is one element, not twenty. Text and image
//! operations draw as the positioned elements GPUI's own text and images
//! are, above the shapes they follow.
//!
//! The window machinery the custom view held generalizes onto it: the
//! drawing area's bounds are tracked as it is laid out (pointer positions
//! arrive in the canvas's own coordinates, and the size the layout gave
//! it is named in the view's render context, a change asking the view to
//! draw again), a drag continues outside it, and the window's
//! deactivation ends one whose release the window can no longer see.
//! Input rides the designed tree's events: the pointer's down, move (a
//! drag's, coalesced to the latest while one is in flight, as the custom
//! view's were), up, enter and leave, the wheel, a double click and the
//! secondary button, each carrying the point in the canvas's space and
//! the modifiers held; keys ride the node's own `onKey` as every
//! focusable node's do, all non-reserved keys with their modifiers — Tab,
//! Enter and Escape stay with Pane, as they always have. A canvas naming
//! the semantic handlers (`onIncrement`, `onDecrement`, `onActivate`)
//! takes the up and down arrows and Space itself, so a control-like
//! canvas needs no key parsing.
//!
//! The canvas is one node to assistive technology, with the role its
//! tree named from the widened set, its label and its value; the drawing
//! adds no nodes of its own. It is keyed like every stateful node, so
//! its focus, its drag and its bounds survive a re-render that still
//! draws it.
