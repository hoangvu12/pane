//! A designed view's tree, drawn with GPUI's flex layout: the layout
//! primitives, the shared UI components, and the tokens and raw values
//! the tree styles with, resolved onto Pane's theme in light and dark
//! (`docs/designed-tree.md`, ADR 0036, #237). The tree the launcher holds
//! is typed ([`pane_core::DesignedTree`]); the window never meets the
//! JSON the extension answered with. Layout is computed here, whole: a
//! `column` and a `row` are flex containers with the space tokens
//! resolved onto Pane's spacing rhythm, a `stack` places its children
//! over each other, a `scroll` scrolls, and the shared components draw
//! from Pane's own control families (`ui::controls`, `ui::keycap`,
//! `ui::extension_icon`), so an extension's screen is Pane's design, not
//! a copy of it. Every node may carry a [`Style`] — sizing and a surface
//! with `hover` and `pressed` variants Pane applies itself, never asking
//! the extension.
//!
//! What the window keeps for the tree is kept by key (#238,
//! [`reconcile`]): the focus of each focusable control, the editing state
//! of each text field — the text, the caret, the selection, the input
//! method's composition — the select's own open state, and each scroll
//! region's position, so a re-render that still draws a node keeps what
//! the user was doing with it. The fields are partially controlled: they
//! edit at once, their input events are coalesced to the latest while
//! one is in flight (and throttled, when a field asks), their commits go
//! out on Enter and blur, and a value the extension sets — one that
//! differs from the node's value in the extension's previous render —
//! replaces the text.
//!
//! The interactive components are focusable, in tree order: Tab and
//! Shift+Tab move through them, and Enter and Space press the focused
//! one (bound in [`bind_keys`], under each control's key context, which
//! sits below the launcher's window context). Escape stays with Pane, as
//! it does for a custom view: it pops the navigation stack (#239),
//! leaving the screen when only the root view is on it. Events are
//! raised on the tree the user saw — each control carries the render it
//! was drawn from, and a node's handler still named by the view's tree
//! receives the event even after a later render, while one that went is
//! dropped (the launcher's stale-event rule).
//!
//! Pressing a control hands its callback id to the launcher
//! ([`Launcher::send_designed_seen`]), which sends the event to the view
//! and shows the tree it answers with; the extension's state lives in
//! its view, and the whole screen is redrawn from the answer.
