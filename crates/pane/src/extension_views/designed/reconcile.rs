//! The keyed reconciler: what the window keeps for a designed view's
//! tree, by key (#238). Each new tree is walked against the previous one
//! by path key — a parent's key composed with the child's own, or its
//! position when it gives none — and per key the window keeps: GPUI CE's
//! editing state of a text field (the text, the caret, the selection and
//! the input method's composition, with undo and the clipboard), the
//! searchable select's own open state, query and highlight, the focus of
//! every focusable control, and a scroll region's position. A key that
//! disappears loses its state; a node of a different kind under the same
//! key is new. This generalises the form's `shape`/`FormControls`
//! reconciliation (its field ids are keys, its `EditableTextState` the
//! same) and #235's per-path focus map, which the keyed state replaces.
//!
//! Hover and pressed are the style's declarative variants and the
//! element's own state, kept by the element's id — the path — so a keyed
//! node keeps them across a re-render that still draws it; the
//! accessibility ids are the paths with it.
//!
//! Keys shared by siblings, and stateful nodes without one, are matched
//! by position instead (the tree walk appends the index for those) — the
//! fallback the runtime reports in a developed package's log.
//!
//! The inputs are partially controlled: the field edits at once (IME,
//! undo and the clipboard never wait for the extension) and the value the
//! tree names is an instruction only when it differs from the value the
//! extension's previous render named — an unchanged value is no
//! instruction, and neither is one the field itself reported (its own
//! text, or a value an input or change event carried), so echoing the
//! field's value back never fights fast typing. A value that counts as
//! set replaces the text and moves the caret to its end.
