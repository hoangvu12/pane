//! The launcher window: orchestration of the launcher's screens, navigation
//! and action dispatch.
//!
//! [`LauncherWindow`] is a thin renderer over [`pane_core::Launcher`]: key
//! and mouse input call launcher actions, and each frame draws the
//! launcher's snapshot. The query field, forms and custom views bind their
//! data in their own modules — [`crate::features`] and
//! [`crate::extension_views`] — whose `impl LauncherWindow` blocks supply
//! the per-screen sync and render methods this orchestration calls.
