//! The workbench's scenarios over Pane's own Settings pages and the
//! launcher's form (#99).
//!
//! Only the Appearance page has an authored board; the other pages are
//! derived compositions of the board's families (`ui::controls`), so these
//! scenarios are native-only: captured, declared and measured against
//! their own declaration, never compared with a board the reference does
//! not have. Each page is drawn through its own production composition
//! (`features::settings::<page>::compose`, the form's parts in
//! `extension_views::form`) over fixture data, inside the Settings board's
//! shell (the board's sidebar, the section nearest the page selected) or
//! the launcher's panel. The data covers what #99 asks native examples of:
//! a select (the Launcher page's, opened by a click), a text form and its
//! validation (the form), shortcut recording (the General page's recorder,
//! listening), extension management and a confirmation (the Extensions
//! page), a long error (the recorder's refusal) and unavailable items (the
//! tray switch, a select choice, a management row).
//!
//! The declaration is the controls' own arithmetic, part by part: a page's
//! column of field groups, each a label over settings rows (a rule along
//! each row's top, its label and description, its control at its right
//! end — a well, a button, a switch), segmented choices, list items and
//! notes, from the theme's tokens and the widths the text system shapes
//! (each label's box rounded up to a whole pixel, as GPUI lays text out).
