//! The launcher's in-app navigation bindings: the bounded set of host
//! actions the Keyboard page rebinds, applied to the window layer's key
//! bindings.
//!
//! [`pane_core::Keyboard`] is the renderer-independent value — one
//! [`pane_core::Binding`] per action, recorded in the host settings. This
//! module is where that value meets the keymap: [`bind_keys`] registers
//! each action under its effective binding, in the contexts the action
//! works in, and [`rebuild`] re-makes the whole keymap when a binding
//! changes, so the previous binding is replaced rather than piling up
//! beside the new one.
//!
//! The contexts, and why each action needs them:
//!
//! - **The launcher's window** (`"Launcher"`): every action of the set.
//!   They are window-local — the same keystroke may serve the Settings
//!   window, whose own keys bind in its context — and they sit *below*
//!   the deeper contexts of a focused field, an open form, a custom view
//!   or the footer menu, whose keys win while those controls hold focus.
//! - **The search field** (`"RootSearch > EditableText"`): previous and
//!   next result only, so the selection moves while the query field has
//!   focus instead of the field's own caret keys acting, as the fixed
//!   Up and Down always did. The other actions bubble to the window's
//!   context from the field, as Enter and Escape always did.
//!
//! Text editing and text composition stay owned by the focused field:
//! [`pane_core::Binding::protected`] refuses the keys that would swallow
//! them, and the recorder's own cancellation keys are bound deeper than
//! any action of the set, so recording never triggers the action being
//! rebound.
