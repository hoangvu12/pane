//! Pane's semantic design tokens: the one place colors, type and geometry
//! come from. Every value is stated by role, not by screen, so restyling is
//! a one-file edit.
//!
//! Provenance: the dark palette, the geometry and the control chrome are the
//! authored reference values, read from
//! `docs/evidence/ui-prototype/reference/REFERENCE.md` and the unchanged
//! authored `launcher.html` retained beside it.
//! The light palette is *derived*, not authored: the reference ships dark
//! only. Light keeps the reference's geometry and icon gradients and swaps
//! the neutrals for light-glass counterparts; it is a starting point for
//! review, not a claim of reference fidelity.
//!
//! No globals: the host settings resolve the user's preference (and the
//! system's appearance, where the preference follows it) to one palette
//! and pass the built [`Theme`] down.
//!
//! Contrast honesty — no blanket accessibility claim. The dark glass is
//! the reference's dark panel composited over whatever is behind the
//! window: over a bright (white) desktop the .7 tint yields about #5c5d5f,
//! where the muted role is ~2.04:1 and the title role ~5.64:1. That is
//! dark glass over a bright desktop, not a light theme, and it varies
//! with the desktop. The reference's 55%-alpha floor is its own design
//! rule, not a readability guarantee, and the light palette's body-level
//! neutrals are a legibility choice, not a certified ratio. Opaque mode is
//! the explicit deterministic fallback.
