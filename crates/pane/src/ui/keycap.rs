//! The shared keycap: a presentation-only keystroke component.
//!
//! A keycap shows one key's glyph in a small cap of the reference's control
//! chrome — the neutral tile's background, inset edge and top highlight at
//! the keycap's own scale — and names the key to assistive technology, so
//! the cap a user sees and the key a screen reader reads cannot diverge.
//! Both come from the same value: a [`Key`] with its own glyph, or a
//! [`pane_core::Binding`] named in text by [`binding_keycap`].
//!
//! Presentation only: the component renders the key it is given and knows
//! nothing of actions or bindings. The caller that knows the effective
//! binding chooses the key (the launcher's footer passes the invoke
//! action's binding, which is the Enter key until the Keyboard page rebinds
//! it — and the Enter key keeps its glyph, whatever else takes its place).
//!
//! The cap is an accessibility node — an image named for the key — so its
//! name is exposed wherever a keycap is placed. Its id is fixed, so a
//! parent that shows several keycaps in one scope wraps each in its own
//! container.
