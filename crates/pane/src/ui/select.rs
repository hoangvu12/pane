//! Pane's searchable select: the choice control for a setting whose
//! options a user may want to search rather than scan — a trigger row
//! showing the committed choice, opening an L2 popover that holds a
//! local search field and the choices as rows. The search is local and
//! optional to *use*: a blank query lists every choice in the
//! consumer's order, and typing narrows it — no list is too short for
//! the control, and no search is forced on one.
//!
//! Interaction reference: the Raycast dropdown and the shadcn combobox
//! as *behavior* references only (`docs/research/searchable-settings-
//! selects.md`) — the visual language is entirely Pane's, the reference's
//! families (#99, `ui::controls`): the trigger an inline well at a settings
//! row's end (the row names the setting and says what it does), the L2
//! popover material with its own shadows at the trigger's width, the well
//! for the popup's search field, and the Actions panel's entries for the
//! choices. Nothing fades:
//! the Settings board's controls change at once. Nothing here imports a
//! React toolkit, re-creates the theme, or knows what a setting is.
//!
//! ## State: the control's own, and only the control's
//!
//! The control is one [`Select`] entity, embedded by its consumer as a
//! child. It owns everything transient — open or closed, the query, the
//! highlighted (active) choice — and owns its whole interaction: the
//! popup's opening and dismissal, the query's local filtering, the
//! arrows' movement of the highlight, Enter's commit, Escape's cancel,
//! Tab's leave. The committed choice is *not* transient state: the
//! consumer supplies it live through the model callback every render,
//! and commits travel out through the `on_commit` callback into the
//! consumer's own persistence path. Opening, filtering and highlighting
//! never save anything; a failed save is the consumer's to report, and
//! the trigger simply shows whatever the model holds next — the honest
//! choice, rolled back or not.
//!
//! ## The draft/commit boundary
//!
//! While open, the query filters the choices and the arrows move the
//! highlight; neither touches the committed choice. Enter, or a click on
//! an enabled row, commits that choice through `on_commit` and closes.
//! Escape cancels the whole draft — query and highlight are discarded,
//! nothing is committed — and returns focus to the trigger. Tab and
//! Shift-Tab close without committing and continue focus traversal from
//! the trigger. A mouse-down outside the popup cancels the draft and
//! lets the click land: whatever was clicked takes focus as it would
//! have without the popup. A mouse-down on the trigger itself toggles
//! the popup closed, consuming the click so it cannot reopen.
//!
//! This deliberately differs from the extension form's choice control,
//! where the arrows change the choice and Enter submits the form: this
//! is a settings control with its own draft/commit boundary, and the
//! page around it commits nothing on the form's behalf.
//!
//! ## Placement and constraint
//!
//! The popup is a [`deferred`] + [`anchored`] overlay: deferred so it
//! paints above the whole window (and is not clipped by the page's
//! scroll viewport), anchored below the trigger — it is a child of a
//! zero-height row the control renders after the trigger, so the anchor
//! point is the trigger's bottom-left however tall the trigger grew —
//! and snapped to the window, so a popup that would overflow the
//! window's edge is constrained inside it. The option list scrolls
//! within that bound and keeps the highlighted choice visible. The
//! popup follows the trigger as the page scrolls, being deferred from
//! the trigger's own place in the scrolled content.
//!
//! The popup's own motion is the shared policy's popup family (see
//! [`crate::ui::motion`]): it enters from the trigger over a tiny shift
//! and fade, and exits back toward it, faster, on the same tween
//! machinery every Pane transition runs. The shift and the fade sit on
//! a wrapper *inside* the popup, so the anchored element still measures
//! the popup at its resting size and the window-edge snapping never
//! moves mid-flight. While the exit runs the popup is inert — no row
//! can commit, the whole subtree is hidden from accessibility, and the
//! overlay keeps occluding so a click on it cannot reach the page
//! underneath — and the frame that completes the exit unmounts it, so
//! nothing of a closed popup intercepts a click. Typing, filtering,
//! the highlight's movement and the focus contract are exactly what
//! they were: only the popup's paint moves.
//!
//! ## Accessibility
//!
//! The trigger is a combo box: named, carrying the committed choice as
//! its value and its expanded state. The popup's content is the field's
//! node, as root search's wrapper is — an editable combo box whose list
//! is the choices — the committed one selected, the highlighted one the
//! focused field's active descendant, a choice the system cannot answer
//! disabled with its reason as the description. Keyboard focus sits in
//! the field while the popup is open, so the arrows move the highlight
//! without stealing text focus from the query.
