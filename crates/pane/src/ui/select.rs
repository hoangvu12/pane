//! Pane's searchable select: the choice control for a setting whose
//! options a user may want to search rather than scan — a trigger row
//! showing the committed choice, opening an L2 popover that holds a
//! local search field and the choices as rows. The search is local and
//! optional to *use*: a blank query lists every choice in the
//! consumer's order, and typing narrows it — no list is too short for
//! the control, and no search is forced on one.
//!
//! Interaction reference: the Raycast dropdown and the shadcn combobox
//! as *behavior* references only (`docs/research/searchable-settings-
//! selects.md`) — the visual language is entirely Pane's: the reference's
//! row chrome, the L2 popover material, the shared editable text element
//! for the field, and the semantic theme. Nothing here imports a React
//! toolkit, re-creates the theme, or knows what a setting is.
//!
//! ## State: the control's own, and only the control's
//!
//! The control is one [`Select`] entity, embedded by its consumer as a
//! child. It owns everything transient — open or closed, the query, the
//! highlighted (active) choice — and owns its whole interaction: the
//! popup's opening and dismissal, the query's local filtering, the
//! arrows' movement of the highlight, Enter's commit, Escape's cancel,
//! Tab's leave. The committed choice is *not* transient state: the
//! consumer supplies it live through the model callback every render,
//! and commits travel out through the `on_commit` callback into the
//! consumer's own persistence path. Opening, filtering and highlighting
//! never save anything; a failed save is the consumer's to report, and
//! the trigger simply shows whatever the model holds next — the honest
//! choice, rolled back or not.
//!
//! ## The draft/commit boundary
//!
//! While open, the query filters the choices and the arrows move the
//! highlight; neither touches the committed choice. Enter, or a click on
//! an enabled row, commits that choice through `on_commit` and closes.
//! Escape cancels the whole draft — query and highlight are discarded,
//! nothing is committed — and returns focus to the trigger. Tab and
//! Shift-Tab close without committing and continue focus traversal from
//! the trigger. A mouse-down outside the popup cancels the draft and
//! lets the click land: whatever was clicked takes focus as it would
//! have without the popup. A mouse-down on the trigger itself toggles
//! the popup closed, consuming the click so it cannot reopen.
//!
//! This deliberately differs from the extension form's choice control,
//! where the arrows change the choice and Enter submits the form: this
//! is a settings control with its own draft/commit boundary, and the
//! page around it commits nothing on the form's behalf.
//!
//! ## Placement and constraint
//!
//! The popup is a [`deferred`] + [`anchored`] overlay: deferred so it
//! paints above the whole window (and is not clipped by the page's
//! scroll viewport), anchored below the trigger — it is a child of a
//! zero-height row the control renders after the trigger, so the anchor
//! point is the trigger's bottom-left however tall the trigger grew —
//! and snapped to the window, so a popup that would overflow the
//! window's edge is constrained inside it. The option list scrolls
//! within that bound and keeps the highlighted choice visible. The
//! popup follows the trigger as the page scrolls, being deferred from
//! the trigger's own place in the scrolled content.
//!
//! Nothing here animates: opening, filtering, dismissal and focus are
//! immediate, as the motion policy requires of query and result
//! updates; the popup's entrance micro-transition is the later popup
//! polish ticket's (#88), built on the seams this component leaves.
//!
//! ## Accessibility
//!
//! The trigger is a combo box: named, carrying the committed choice as
//! its value and its expanded state. The popup's field is a text input
//! (the search), the choices a list box's options — the committed one
//! selected, the highlighted one the focused field's active descendant,
//! a choice the system cannot answer disabled with its reason as the
//! description. Keyboard focus sits in the field while the popup is
//! open, so the arrows move the highlight without stealing text focus
//! from the query.
