//! Pane's shared motion policy: the one place the launcher's animation
//! timings, curves and distances come from, and the rules that keep
//! animation strictly presentation-only.
//!
//! Provenance: the timings and the paired forward/back shape are adapted
//! from Roboco's pinned motion catalog
//! (`docs/research/roboco-motion-settings.md`), which the approved scope
//! extension of #70 names as the experiential reference — not as constants
//! to copy into a different solver. The starting points are the ticket's
//! own: entrances around 120-180ms, a faster return, a 2-4 logical pixel
//! shift, fast-starting and gently-settling easing, no exaggerated bounce,
//! no per-row cascade, no animated typing. The curve itself is GPUI CE's
//! pinned `ease_out_quint` (quintic ease-out), so the pinned renderer
//! stays the only animation toolkit: nothing here re-implements springs
//! or timelines. The one mechanism is the same one Roboco's native
//! helpers use for interruptible motion at their renderer revision —
//! progress measured on a clock, frames requested from the render tail —
//! because GPUI's `with_animation` clock restarts from zero whenever its
//! element identity changes, which replays an entrance mid-exit (the
//! pinned Roboco helper documents exactly that limitation).
//!
//! What animates and what never does:
//!
//! - A **view transition** — the launcher's screen *kind* changes (root
//!   search to a command, a command back to root, a form or custom view
//!   opening or closing) — moves the content that changes: the arriving
//!   content fades in over a tiny directional shift. The shift is a
//!   relative `top` inset, applied after layout like a CSS transform, so
//!   the stable shell chrome (the panel, the footer with its action
//!   strip, the query field, the heading) never moves. The departing
//!   content is unmounted at once: it is never drawn fading out, so it
//!   can expose no hit targets, no active accessibility nodes, and cannot
//!   pin a departed screen or a guest runtime generation — the
//!   transition holds no screen, no rows and no callbacks at all.
//! - A **query or result update** — typing, rows changing, selection,
//!   status, a screen's own contents — never animates. Navigation,
//!   dispatch, cancellation and focus are applied by the launcher before
//!   any frame draws; the transition only paints what already changed, so
//!   it can never rerun a command, delay its request, resubmit a form,
//!   change history or wait for typing. A rapid open/back/open starts the
//!   next transition from the current presentation (the interrupted
//!   offset), so a reversal retargets smoothly instead of flashing.
//!
//! Reduced motion: [`App::reduce_motion`] decides, and
//! [`observe_reduced_motion`] connects that flag to what the operating
//! system actually reports — see that function for what is detected on
//! each system and what the documented fallback is there. Where the
//! system reports changes while Pane runs, a change lands on the next
//! drawn frame: engaged mid-transition, that frame settles at once and
//! schedules no further cosmetic frames.
//!
//! Frame discipline: a view transition runs for its bounded duration and
//! requests animation frames only while one is in flight. Completing,
//! cancelling (the screen changed again), reduced motion, an unmounted
//! window and a hidden window all end with a frame that requests nothing —
//! the window is idle. Since progress is measured on a clock rather than
//! counted in frames, a window that was hidden mid-transition settles on
//! the first frame it is shown again and then stops; there is no ambient
//! animation of any kind. The functional scroll relayout in
//! [`crate::app::LauncherWindow::keep_selected_visible`] is untouched: it
//! keeps its own, separate request for one more frame.
//!
//! The clock is the background executor's (`App::background_executor().now()`,
//! which on native targets *is* `std::time::Instant`), not the wall clock:
//! the same choice GPUI CE's own animation and spring elements make, so
//! animation progress is deterministic under the test platform's
//! controlled clock.
