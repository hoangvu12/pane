//! The update Pane applies by itself, in the native window on GPUI's test
//! platform: what its pass came to reaches the window by itself, as a
//! failure's announcement — a pass that failed something is announced
//! once, the next time the launcher is shown — and the update results
//! view the announcement's View Details opens works by keyboard, as any
//! list does. The wiring is the real app's order — the launcher's
//! constructor starts the updater's thread before `with_development`
//! wires the channel that tells the window — so a thread holding a
//! launcher snapshot from before the wiring still has to reach the
//! window.
//!
//! The registry is a local one on 127.0.0.1 (`pane-core`'s test support)
//! or a closed port standing for one that is down; nothing reaches the
//! network. The launcher's clock is a manual one, so the first check — a
//! minute after Pane starts — comes when the test moves it.
