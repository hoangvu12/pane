//! The host's registry of what extensions registered at run time (ADR
//! 0041, #158): dynamic root items, timers, folder watchers and run-time
//! provisions, each an owned registration the guest holds as a WIT
//! resource.
//!
//! A registration lasts until the first of three: the guest dropping its
//! handle (the host side of the resource runs its `drop` here), the
//! instance holding it going away (a crash, a stopped call, an
//! unresponsive stop, a search cancellation — every instance drop ends
//! its registrations, through [`crate::runtime::GuestState`]'s own
//! `Drop`), or the generation ending (the package is disabled, paused,
//! reloaded, updated or uninstalled). Each entry records how it is undone
//! on its generation's undo list ([`crate::generation`], #136); ending it
//! another way takes the entry off the list, and the undo list's test
//! hook finds it empty after every generation ends.
//!
//! The registry is shared: the runtime's guests reach it from their host
//! functions, the launcher reads it (root search's dynamic rows, the
//! timers and watchers threads' work, the provisions the operation router
//! and the waiting model see), and whichever thread ends a generation or
//! drops an instance runs its teardown. Its lock is held only for short,
//! self-contained work — never while calling a hook, never while taking
//! another lock — so no caller can deadlock on it.
//!
//! What changes tells the hooks ([`Registrations::set_changed`]), with
//! the lock let go: the launcher's refreshes root search, recomputes who
//! waits (a run-time provision makes the package a provider) and sees to
//! the activation entry point; the timers and watchers threads are woken
//! to take their new work. The activation entry point's own tracking
//! lives here too: which instance ran it for which generation, so its
//! instance going while the generation continues starts it again.
