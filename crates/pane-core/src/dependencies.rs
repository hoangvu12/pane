//! Dependencies between extension packages: what installing a package
//! means for the packages it declares under `dependencies` in its
//! `pane.json`, worked out before anything is installed, and installing
//! them together.
//!
//! - A **required** dependency that is not installed is installed with the
//!   package, before it, after its own required dependencies. One that is
//!   installed is used as it is: Pane never replaces an installed copy while
//!   installing another package, so an installed copy acts as pinned, and
//!   one the user disabled, or Pane paused, stays so.
//! - An **optional** dependency is never installed with the package; it is
//!   listed, and used when the user installs it.
//! - A dependency is **compatible** when its package supports this system
//!   and publishes every operation the declaring package names, at the
//!   version it names. There is one copy per source, so two packages naming
//!   different versions of one operation of the same source conflict: Pane
//!   explains it rather than solving for several versions.
//! - **Cycles** are allowed: each source is visited once, so packages that
//!   require each other are installed together. At most
//!   [`MAX_INSTALLED_WITH`] packages are installed with the requested one.
//! - Anything that stops a required dependency from being installed stops
//!   the whole install before anything changes. A failure while installing
//!   undoes what this install added, so a failed install never leaves a
//!   package installed without its required dependencies; what could not
//!   be undone is reported as installed.
//!
//! A [`Plan`] is data: the required edges it found, the optional
//! dependencies, the problems, and the [`Assumptions`] it rests on, which
//! the launcher checks again before installing. Wording is only in the
//! `Display` implementations and [`Plan::lines`].
