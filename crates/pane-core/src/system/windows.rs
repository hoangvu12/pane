//! The system functions on Windows (see the parent module): the clipboard
//! through the clipboard adapter's own window, opening with
//! `ShellExecuteExW`, File Explorer's selection with
//! `SHOpenFolderAndSelectItems`, and the Recycle Bin with
//! `SHFileOperationW`. COM is initialized on the calling thread (one of
//! Pane's own, for this call) while the shell is used.
//!
//! The Windows power features' halves (#125) are here too. The front
//! application is the window the watcher records (given to this adapter
//! when Pane starts, `crate::system::native`): its name and icon are
//! resolved best-effort through the window's AppUserModelID, its
//! program's path or its process's package identity against the
//! installed applications. Paste brings that window back to the front on
//! a worker with a timeout, waiting until it really is in front, then
//! sends it a tagged Ctrl+V (`SendInput`, every key Pane injects carries
//! Pane's own tag) — skipping a window that is gone, not responding or
//! running as administrator (detected from its process's elevation
//! before any key is sent, since Windows would drop them), each answered
//! with a failure that leaves what was put on the clipboard there, still
//! tagged, for the user to paste by hand. The clipboard's earlier
//! contents are put back after a short delay, unless something else was
//! copied meanwhile: every format it held in ordinary memory, tagged as
//! a concealed copy is, so neither Pane's history nor Windows' own keeps
//! the paste or the restore. The selected text is read through
//! `selected` (#262): UI Automation in a worker process of Pane's own
//! program and, where that gives nothing, a simulated copy that leaves
//! the clipboard as it was.
