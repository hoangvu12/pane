//! The application in front on Windows (see the parent module): a
//! system foreground event hook — `SetWinEventHook` for
//! `EVENT_SYSTEM_FOREGROUND`, out of process (`WINEVENT_OUTOFCONTEXT`)
//! and cheap, delivered through the message queue of the thread that
//! installed it, whichever process the window belongs to — on a thread
//! of Pane's own (`threads::windows::MessageThread`), started when Pane
//! starts and ended when it ends. Each window that comes to the front
//! is classified by the pure rules beside this; the last one that is a
//! paste target is recorded, with its process, that process's program
//! path and package family — what the front application and the paste
//! read of it. Its title and its AppUserModelID are read when they are
//! asked for, since the window may be gone by then if it closed.
