//! Launch at login on Windows: the `Run` key under
//! `HKEY_CURRENT_USER` — the per-user startup list the shell starts at
//! login. One value, `Pane`, holds the command that starts Pane: the
//! program's own path in double quotes, so a path with spaces stays one
//! command and not several. Setting the value replaces whatever it held,
//! so repeated changes keep exactly one registration, and deleting it
//! removes Pane from the list. No administrator rights are needed: the
//! key is the user's own.
//!
//! The value is Pane's per-user slot: a Pane that finds it holding a
//! different command (an install that moved, an older path) does not
//! treat that as another Pane's registration — it is this Pane's
//! registration, stale, and enabling again rewrites it with the path of
//! the program actually running now. Whether the command then works is
//! the shell's business at login; Pane cannot see it start.
