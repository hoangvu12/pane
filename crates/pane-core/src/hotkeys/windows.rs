//! Global hotkeys on Windows: `RegisterHotKey` on a thread of Pane's own
//! for the chords Windows accepts, and a low-level keyboard hook of
//! Pane's own (`WH_KEYBOARD_LL`) for the chords Windows refuses — another
//! application has the shortcut, or Windows keeps it for itself — and
//! for the binding kinds no registration can express: a lone tap or a
//! double tap of a modifier, a side-specific modifier, a numpad key
//! (#260) — so a refused shortcut is never an error: the binding works
//! while Pane runs (ADR 0039). A conflict shows as
//! `ERROR_HOTKEY_ALREADY_REGISTERED`, which is the hook's cue rather than
//! the user's problem. No permission is needed.
//!
//! A hotkey belongs to the thread that registered it, so registering and
//! releasing are done by that thread: the caller queues the request, wakes
//! the thread with a thread message and waits for its answer. Dropping the
//! adapter ends the thread, which releases its hotkeys as it ends. The
//! thread is a `threads::windows::MessageThread`, like the clipboard
//! listener's.
//!
//! A recorder that listens asks for a recording session
//! ([`Hotkeys::recording`], #260): the hook then holds every key back
//! from the system — Escape and Tab excepted, so the recorder's own
//! cancellation keys work — and reports what the user presses to the
//! session, which lasts until the recorder stops listening, a window of
//! another process comes in front, or Pane quits.
//!
//! The hook lives on a thread of its own, started when the first binding
//! or session needs it and stopped when none does. Its callback runs at the
//! highest thread priority — not a raised process priority, so the rest of
//! Pane is unaffected — and only steps the recognizer (see `recognizer`)
//! and posts a message to the adapter's thread when a binding fires: it
//! never allocates, takes no lock another thread holds, and calls nothing
//! outside `user32`'s input machinery. While the Windows key is bound
//! alone, the release that completes its tap — and the release of a
//! Windows key whose chord Pane swallowed — carries the Start-menu mask
//! first: a tagged neutral key injected before the release reaches
//! Windows, so Explorer does not open the Start menu (which stays on the
//! taskbar's Start button and Ctrl+Esc). Its code and data pages are
//! locked in memory after the process's minimum working set is raised by
//! what they need, so a trimmed working set cannot fault the callback
//! past Windows' hook timeout; if Windows refuses, the diagnostic says
//! the pages are not pinned. A watchdog window that receives raw keyboard
//! input notices when key events stop reaching the hook — Windows has
//! silently removed it — and installs it again, giving up with a
//! diagnostic after repeated failures within a short time. The
//! recognizer's modifiers are re-read from the system on a session
//! unlock, on a resume and when an event contradicts them, so a release
//! missed while the secure desktop had the keyboard never leaves a
//! modifier stuck down. Keys Pane injects carry [`INJECTED_TAG`], which
//! the recognizer answers by passing them through untouched.
