//! The binding recognizer: the pure state machine that decides, from the
//! stream of key events, whether one of the bindings Pane bound was
//! pressed, and what a recording session recognized.
//!
//! It is compiled on every system and knows nothing of Windows: the
//! Windows half of the hotkey adapter feeds it the key events its
//! `WH_KEYBOARD_LL` hook sees ([`KeyEvent`]) and carries out what it
//! decides ([`Decision`]). The tests drive it with synthetic sequences on
//! every system, so the binding logic is checked without a Windows
//! machine.
//!
//! The rules match what `RegisterHotKey` does for the chords Windows
//! accepts, so a binding behaves the same whichever way it is
//! dispatched:
//!
//! - a chord fires when its key is pressed while exactly its modifiers
//!   are held, whatever keys were pressed between the modifiers and it;
//!   a modifier the binding names by a side is held on that side, and
//!   one it does not name is not held at all (#260);
//! - the key press that fires a chord, and its release, are swallowed, so
//!   the system does not also give the chord its own meaning; modifier
//!   presses and releases always pass through;
//! - a key pressed while already down is its auto-repeat: it fires
//!   nothing and repeats nothing;
//! - a lone tap of a modifier fires when it is released with no other key
//!   pressed between, within [`TAP_MS`] (#260); a double tap fires on the
//!   modifier's second press, with nothing between, within
//!   [`DOUBLE_MS`], and its first press passes through to applications,
//!   as every modifier's press and release does — or its state sticks
//!   for the system;
//! - a key Pane itself injected, tagged [`INJECTED_TAG`], is passed
//!   through untouched: Pane never reacts to its own input;
//! - a key another tool injected is recognized like the user's — a
//!   remapper sends the keys the user pressed, and the binding must work —
//!   but never swallowed: the key is the tool's, not Pane's to take. Such
//!   keys do not count as the user's for the liveness watchdog either
//!   (they are not the keyboard's; see [`Recognizer::physical_events`]);
//! - while the Windows key is held, a key Pane took — the key of a chord
//!   it swallowed, or the second press of a double tap it fired — makes
//!   the Windows key's release carry [`Decision::Tap`] with its mask, or
//!   [`Decision::Mask`]: the adapter injects a tagged neutral key before
//!   the release reaches Windows, so the Start menu the release of a
//!   lone Windows key opens stays closed (the mask, #260). A Windows key
//!   released after a key Pane did not take passes through as it is, so
//!   Win+&lt;key&gt; chords keep Windows' meaning;
//! - a modifier event that contradicts the state Pane holds of the
//!   keyboard asks for the modifiers to be re-read from the system
//!   ([`Decision::Resync`]), as a session unlock and a resume do, so a
//!   release Pane missed never leaves a modifier stuck down for a
//!   phantom chord or up for a missed one.
//!
//! While a recording session listens, the same state machine runs in
//! recording mode ([`Recognizer::recording`]): every key event is held
//! back from the system — the Start menu the Windows key alone opens
//! stays closed — and each chord candidate (a key pressed with the
//! modifiers held, each any side or the one named) and each lone tap and
//! double tap recognized is reported ([`Recorded`]) for the recorder to
//! check as the window's own recorder checks a keystroke. Escape and Tab
//! never reach it: the adapter lets them through, so the recorder's own
//! cancellation keys work.
//!
//! One gap is deliberate: the first release of the Windows key of a
//! bound double tap — `double:win` without `tap:win` — passes through
//! unmasked, so the Start menu it opens opens; the tap that would mask
//! it is not bound, and nothing Pane could hold before the second press
//! would say whether one comes. The guard that refuses a single tap and
//! a double tap of the same modifier bound together keeps the two from
//! meeting in the recognizer; where a hand-edited record holds both
//! anyway, the release fires the tap and the second press the double,
//! each as it is recognized.
