//! The applications installed on the system: finding them, knowing which
//! application each is, and opening them.
//!
//! A WASI guest cannot see or start the system's applications, so Pane's host
//! does it for the Applications default extension through the
//! `pane:extension/applications` import ([`Applications`]). Each system has
//! its own adapter, a [`Discovery`] chosen by [`native`], which reports the
//! [`Source`]s it finds:
//!
//! - Windows: the shortcuts (shell links, internet shortcuts with a
//!   registered scheme, ClickOnce references) in the Start menu's Programs
//!   folders, on the Desktops and pinned to the taskbar, and the packaged
//!   apps of the Apps folder ([`StartMenu`]);
//! - macOS: the application bundles in the Applications folders ([`AppBundles`]);
//! - Linux: the XDG desktop entries in the `applications` data folders
//!   ([`DesktopEntries`]).
//!
//! The host turns those sources into applications with a stable identity
//! ([`identity`], ADR 0038): sources with one [`Key`] are one application,
//! whose id is a digest of the key, and the host keeps the map from each id
//! to the source that opens it ([`Cached`]), so an id survives an update that
//! moves the program, and an id from before identities (a source's path)
//! still finds its application. Each application is titled as the system
//! shows it (localized) and carries the other names and words that find it
//! and what tells it apart from applications of the same name ([`names`]).
//!
//! The host's list stays current by itself while a package that asked for
//! it runs ([`Cached`], ADR 0038): each adapter watches the folders it
//! finds sources in ([`Discovery::watch`]), the list is rescanned once
//! their changes settle, and an application whose last source went stays
//! listed for a grace before it leaves.
//!
//! Finding is plain file system work and is compiled on every system, so each
//! adapter's discovery is tested everywhere with fixture folders; opening uses
//! the system's own launcher and works only on its system.
