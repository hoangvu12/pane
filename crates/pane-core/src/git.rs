//! Extension packages distributed as Git repositories.
//!
//! A Git-distributed Pane package is a repository whose root holds a
//! `pane.json` and, in the revision installed, the built components it names
//! (a *release* revision, such as a release tag or branch its author commits
//! the built files to). A revision holding only the source is explained, not
//! built: Pane never runs a build, a hook or anything else from a repository.
//!
//! Pane fetches the repository itself, speaking Git's smart HTTP protocol
//! (version 2) over HTTPS through Pane's one HTTP client
//! ([`crate::http`]); no `git` program, library or configuration is used, so
//! hooks, filters, `core.fsmonitor`, `core.sshCommand`, `GIT_*` variables and
//! the user's or the repository's Git configuration have no effect. It:
//!
//! 1. asks the server for its capabilities (`info/refs`), which must be
//!    protocol version 2 with SHA-1 object ids;
//! 2. resolves the reference asked for (`ls-refs`): none is the default
//!    branch, else a branch or a tag of that name, or a full commit id;
//! 3. fetches exactly that one commit, without its history (`fetch` with
//!    `want <commit>` and `deepen 1`), as one pack;
//! 4. reads the pack (its checksum, each object's zlib stream, deltas),
//!    computing every object's SHA-1 id with collision detection, so the
//!    files written are exactly the tree of the commit asked for;
//! 5. writes that tree into a download folder of its own
//!    ([`crate::downloads`]), taking only regular files and folders whose
//!    names every system can write: a symbolic link, a submodule, a `.git`
//!    entry, two names differing only in case, or any name a system reads
//!    differently refuses the whole revision. Nothing is written executable.
//!
//! The pack, the objects, the files and the folders are limited in size and
//! number ([`MAX_PACK`], [`MAX_OBJECTS`], [`MAX_UNPACKED`], [`MAX_ENTRIES`],
//! [`MAX_DEPTH`]), and what a pack takes in memory while it is read,
//! inflated entries and the objects its deltas make together, by one budget
//! ([`MAX_INFLATED`]).
//!
//! Only `https://` addresses are fetched. SSH (`ssh://`, `git@host:path`) and
//! scheme-less (`host/path`) addresses name the same repository, fetched
//! over HTTPS from the same host and path. Tests and development builds may
//! also fetch `http://` from a loopback address written as one
//! (`127.x.y.z`, `[::1]`), so that no check reaches the network.
