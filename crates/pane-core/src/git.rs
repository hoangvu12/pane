//! Extension packages distributed as Git repositories.
//!
//! A Git-distributed Pane package is a repository whose root holds a
//! `pane.json` and, in the revision installed, the built components it names
//! (a *release* revision, such as a release tag or branch its author commits
//! the built files to). A revision holding only the source is explained, not
//! built: Pane never runs a build, a hook or anything else from a repository.
//!
//! Pane fetches the repository itself, speaking Git's smart HTTP protocol
//! (version 2) over HTTPS through Pane's one HTTP client
//! ([`crate::http`]); no `git` program, library or configuration is used, so
//! hooks, filters, `core.fsmonitor`, `core.sshCommand`, `GIT_*` variables and
//! the user's or the repository's Git configuration have no effect. It:
//!
//! 1. asks the server for its capabilities (`info/refs`), which must be
//!    protocol version 2 with SHA-1 object ids;
//! 2. resolves the reference asked for (`ls-refs`): none is the default
//!    branch, else a branch or a tag of that name, or a full commit id;
//! 3. fetches exactly that one commit, without its history (`fetch` with
//!    `want <commit>` and `deepen 1`), as one pack;
//! 4. reads the pack (its checksum, each object's zlib stream, deltas),
//!    computing every object's SHA-1 id with collision detection, so the
//!    files written are exactly the tree of the commit asked for;
//! 5. writes that tree into a download folder of its own
//!    ([`crate::downloads`]), taking only regular files and folders whose
//!    names every system can write: a symbolic link, a submodule, a `.git`
//!    entry (in any case, as `git~1`, or with characters HFS+ ignores), two
//!    names differing only in case, or a name some system cannot write or
//!    reads as another (such as a Windows device name, or one ending in a
//!    dot) refuses the whole revision. Names that differ only in Unicode
//!    normalization are not compared. Nothing is written executable.
//!
//! The pack, the objects, the files and the folders are limited in size and
//! number ([`MAX_PACK`], [`MAX_OBJECTS`], [`MAX_UNPACKED`], [`MAX_ENTRIES`],
//! [`MAX_DEPTH`]), and what a pack takes in memory while it is read,
//! inflated entries and the objects its deltas make together, by one budget
//! ([`MAX_INFLATED`]).
//!
//! Where the server advertises Git's partial-clone filter, a revision that
//! holds a collection (ADR 0044) is fetched without its file contents
//! instead: the commit and its trees with `filter blob:none`, then the
//! blobs — the collection's index, each extension's manifest and icon, to
//! list the choice, and the files of the extensions chosen from it, one
//! fetch for every one of them — named by their ids, so installing from a
//! large repository downloads only what is installed. Every object is
//! checked against its id in every pack, and the limits bound what is
//! written across the fetches (each pack on its own). A server that
//! advertises no filter, and a repository that is one extension, are
//! fetched whole as above.
//!
//! Only `https://` addresses are fetched. SSH (`ssh://`, `git@host:path`) and
//! scheme-less (`host/path`) addresses name the same repository, fetched
//! over HTTPS from the same host and path. Tests and development builds may
//! also fetch `http://` from a loopback address written as one
//! (`127.x.y.z`, `[::1]`), so that no check reaches the network.
