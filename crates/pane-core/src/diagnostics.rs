//! Pane's own diagnostics and its local crash record (#133).
//!
//! **One diagnostic path.** Every message Pane writes to standard error, in
//! this crate and in the `pane` crate, goes through [`report`] (or the
//! [`diagnostic!`](crate::diagnostic) macro over it): it writes the message
//! to standard error as Pane always did — a developer running Pane from a
//! terminal sees no change — and to Pane's log, where a windowed Windows
//! build's diagnostics would otherwise go nowhere. An extension's own
//! output is not included. Nothing here panics: a diagnostic written from
//! a window procedure or a panic hook only loses its line when it cannot
//! be written.
//!
//! **The log** (`log`) is `pane.log` in the logs folder Pane's binary
//! names (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Pane\logs`, `~/Library/Logs/Pane`,
//! `$XDG_STATE_HOME/pane/logs`, or `logs` in `PANE_DATA_DIR`), readable by
//! the user only: size-capped and rotated, rate-limited per site, and
//! redacted at its writer (`redact`) — the home folder's path, the user's
//! name and the computer's are replaced before anything is written. Pane's
//! own messages are written so that none carries extension data values,
//! local credentials, clipboard history text, query text or found file
//! names; an address an extension asked for is named by its host only.
//!
//! **Panics** are written to the log (message, location and any captured
//! backtrace) by a panic hook before the default handling.
//!
//! **The marker** (`marker`) lets the next start tell that a run ended
//! unexpectedly, which the launcher shows as one root result and Settings'
//! About page as a notice.
//!
//! Nothing is sent anywhere: no telemetry, no crash upload, no minidump.
