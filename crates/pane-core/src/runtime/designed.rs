//! What a designed view renders, as its `view.render` answers it: a JSON
//! document naming the version of the UI component set it uses, and a root
//! node (`docs/designed-tree.md`, ADR 0036's envelope for the tree #121
//! introduces). Reading it here keeps the JSON at the edge of the runtime:
//! the launcher sees only the typed [`DesignedTree`], and the window draws
//! from it without meeting JSON at all.
//!
//! Reading is strict in the document's shape and lenient exactly where
//! versioning asks for it. A property Pane does not know is ignored; a
//! node whose type Pane does not know, or whose `requires` it does not
//! meet, draws the `fallback` the author gave, else its children; a
//! document of Pane's major version and any minor is read for what Pane
//! understands of it. A document that is not JSON, lacks a field Pane
//! needs (`version`, `root`, a node's `type`, a text's `text`, a button's
//! `label`) or gives one of the wrong type is unreadable, which the runtime
//! answers as [`super::CallError::Unreadable`]: the command's failure,
//! never a crash, so it does not count towards pausing the package. A
//! document over one of the limits ([`MAX_NODES`], [`MAX_DEPTH`],
//! [`MAX_TREE_BYTES`], [`MAX_TEXT_CHARS`], [`MAX_MARKDOWN_CHARS`],
//! [`MAX_INLINE_IMAGE`]), or of another major version, is the extension's
//! error ([`ReadError::Guest`]): the view keeps its last good tree either
//! way.
//!
//! The component set of this Pane (1.1) adds the layout primitives
//! (`stack`, `scroll`, `spacer`, `divider`), the sizing and surface every
//! node may carry with their `hover` and `pressed` variants, the shared
//! UI components, the tone token's semantic names, raw colours in every
//! form and Markdown (#237); 1.2 adds the keyed state the reconciler
//! keeps — text fields that edit, the select's searchable state, scroll
//! by key — the inputs' partial control (`onInput`, `throttleMs`, the
//! `focus` ask) and the focus, blur and key events (#238). 1.3 adds the
//! standard views built on the tree (#240): the List with its sections,
//! item keywords, host filtering, controlled search text and selection,
//! the search-bar dropdown, pagination, the empty view and the detail
//! pane; the Grid; the Detail, and Markdown images; the canvas, a leaf
//! the extension draws into (#242, the custom view's successor); and the
//! form — a `form` node whose submission is an action, the field
//! components' titles, notes, errors and remembered values, and the
//! date, tag, file and folder pickers (#241).
