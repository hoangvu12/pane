//! How Pane learns what changed under the index scope (#126, "Catching up
//! and watching, per system"): one change source per system, behind the
//! [`ChangeSource`] trait, so that tests drive catch-up, live changes and
//! fallbacks deterministically (the indexer coordinator takes any source).
//!
//! | | Catch-up at start | Live changes |
//! | --- | --- | --- |
//! | Windows | the NTFS change journal, from the saved cursor, per volume ([`super::read_journal`]) | `ReadDirectoryChangesW` on each root (the `notify` crate) |
//! | macOS | FSEvents' history, replayed by the live stream from the saved event id, per volume | the same FSEvents stream |
//! | Linux | a reconciling walk ([`super::reconcile()`]) | inotify, one watch per folder, the folders past the limit reconciled every few minutes |
//!
//! Whatever the system, a catch-up that cannot use what the system
//! recorded (the journal was recreated or its records discarded, FSEvents'
//! history was purged or the volume changed) asks for a reconciling walk,
//! and an overflow of live changes asks for one of the folder it concerns.
