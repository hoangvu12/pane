//! The name index itself, in the shape of `minidex` (#126, "The engine"):
//! a memory table of recent changes backed by a write-ahead log, immutable
//! segments on disk each with its own term dictionary (and, like the memory
//! table, the terms having each fragment of their words, for the pass
//! inside words) and key filter, tombstones that hide a deleted folder's
//! entries in older segments, and merges of a few segments of similar size
//! at a time, in the background (#187). Its files are Pane's own, versioned
//! by [`FORMAT_VERSION`]: an index of another version is rebuilt, never
//! read.
//!
//! One writer at a time changes the index (its writer lock); queries read
//! it at the same time, never waiting for a segment to be written or
//! merged, only for the moment its result replaces what was there. Merges
//! run on a thread of the index's own ([`Merger`]), at background priority,
//! so that applying changes never waits for one either.
