//! The indexer coordinator (#126 "Where the index lives", #175): opens the
//! file index in Pane's cache folder while a package that uses it
//! (`"fileIndex": true`) is enabled and not paused, catches it up at start,
//! walks what needs walking once the launcher was first shown (or a while
//! after start), keeps it current from the system's change source, and
//! answers searches for the packages that use it, naming each entry by an
//! id the host gives it, which it checks again before anything is done
//! with it.
//!
//! One thread of its own per activation ("pane-file-index"), at background
//! priority, does all the writing; queries read the index at the same time
//! and never wait for a walk. Disabling the last package that uses the
//! index stops watching at once and keeps the index on disk; uninstalling
//! it deletes the index ([`Indexer::delete`]).
//!
//! The safety valves (#126 "Priority and safety valves", #176), each
//! listed on the File search page ([`Indexer::problems`]): a folder that
//! changes constantly is taken out of the index until the user includes it
//! again (churn quarantine, [`Valves::churn_changes`]); a walk stops at a
//! ceiling of entries ([`WalkOptions::max_entries`]); indexing stops
//! writing while the disk holding the cache has too little free space, and
//! starts again once there is room ([`Valves::free_space_floor`]); and a
//! folder that does not answer is skipped for the walk
//! ([`WalkOptions::hung_after`]). Indexing also pauses while the computer
//! sleeps and resumes a few seconds after it wakes, counting only awake
//! time in its limits (`power`, [`Valves::resume_after`]).
