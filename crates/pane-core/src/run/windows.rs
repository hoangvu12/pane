//! The Run dialog's work on Windows (see the parent module): a Control
//! Panel applet runs through the Control Panel program, a bare name is
//! resolved on the search path the registry names at the time of the call
//! (machine and user, as the programs module reads it) and in App Paths —
//! so a tool installed after Pane started is found — and everything else
//! (programs, documents, folders, network paths, `shell:` and
//! `ms-settings:` addresses and other registered schemes) goes through
//! the system's own open (`ShellExecuteExW`, which also opens a folder in
//! File Explorer). An elevated run goes through the same call with the
//! `runas` verb (Windows' own prompt, ADR 0033), waiting only until the
//! shell has started it. The history is Explorer's RunMRU key in its own
//! format (`mru`); the key and the search path are given to the adapter,
//! so the tests use keys and paths of their own, never the user's. The
//! completions are gathered from the same places at each call: the
//! RunMRU key, App Paths' names, the search path's folders, the classes
//! root's registered schemes and the environment's variable names, each
//! read as it is and matched by the pure half. Windows Terminal, for a
//! command that runs a command line in a terminal, is `wt.exe` as App
//! Paths and then the search path spell it.
