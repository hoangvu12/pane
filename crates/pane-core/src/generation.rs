//! Generations: who owns a guest call, and so when it stops.
//!
//! A [`Generation`] is one run of an installed package's code, from when the
//! package is enabled (or installed, or Pane starts) until it is disabled,
//! reloaded, updated or paused after it failed. Every call into the package, and every guest
//! instance serving one, belongs to the generation that was current when the
//! user or another extension asked for it; so does an operation call it
//! serves for another package's call, which also belongs to its caller's
//! generation through the call chain.
//!
//! When a generation ends, the runtime stops its work at once: a call not
//! started yet is not started; a call waiting inside the guest (on a timer,
//! an operation, any async import) is abandoned and its instance, with
//! everything the store holds (views, streams, futures, host tasks), is
//! dropped; a result that completes anyway is discarded; and host imports
//! refuse the stopped code (saving data, calling operations). What it cannot
//! stop is a guest computing without yielding: the runtime thread is inside
//! that guest until it yields or returns (hang recovery is #18).
