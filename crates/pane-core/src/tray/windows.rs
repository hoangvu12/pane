//! The tray entry on Windows: an icon in the notification area
//! (`Shell_NotifyIcon`), owned by a hidden window of a thread of Pane's
//! own whose message loop receives the shell's callback messages. A
//! right click on the icon opens the menu — Open Pane, Settings, Exit,
//! the platform's own labels — and a left click summons the launcher,
//! as the tray's primary action convention is. No permission is needed.
//!
//! Showing and hiding are done by that thread, as registering a hotkey
//! is: the caller queues the request, wakes the thread with a thread
//! message and waits for its answer, because the icon and its menu
//! belong to the thread that made them. Dropping the adapter ends the
//! thread, which deletes the icon and destroys its menu as it ends — so
//! the preference's every change, and the quit path, leave no icon
//! behind.
//!
//! The icon is the one the packaging embeds in Pane's own program (the
//! same resource the window icon loads); a build without one falls back
//! to the system's application icon, honestly plain — the native
//! validation records which one a run saw.
