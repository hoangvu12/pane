//! The clipboard on macOS: the general pasteboard (`NSPasteboard`), whose
//! `changeCount` a thread of Pane's own watches by looking at it every
//! [`POLL`] and reading the pasteboard only when the count moved. That is
//! the established mechanism for a program that owns no run loop: the
//! pasteboard posts `NSPasteboardDidChangeNotification`, but it is
//! delivered through a run loop, which Pane's own threads do not run (the
//! Windows listener has a message queue of its own and the Linux watcher
//! an X11 connection to wait on; polling the count needs neither). Each
//! look costs one integer read, and a copy is reported within [`POLL`] of
//! being made. No permission is needed.
//!
//! On each change the thread, and only it, reads the pasteboard: first the
//! markers, then, only if they allow it, what was copied: the files Finder
//! copied (every item's `public.file-url`), else the text
//! (`NSPasteboardTypeString`), else an image (`public.png` as it is, else
//! `public.tiff` made into a PNG; #167). The de-facto marker of
//! [nspasteboard.org]'s convention, `org.nspasteboard.ConcealedType`,
//! which password managers such as
//! 1Password and Strongbox set when they copy a secret, is honored: its
//! presence alone withholds the text. macOS has no formats answering
//! Windows' history and cloud questions, so those stay unset. The
//! pasteboard never names the program that copied — the server knows the
//! process, but no API of Pane's asks for it — so the source is always
//! unknown and an excluded program, matched by name, never keeps anything
//! out (as the contract says of an unknown owner). What is kept is
//! decided by `clipboard::accept`, the same on every system.
//!
//! [`ClipboardSystem::write_text`] puts the text in the pasteboard
//! server, which holds it for whoever pastes, as any program's copy does,
//! beyond the watch and Pane's own life: no window and no answering
//! thread of Pane's is needed, unlike X11's selection, and a write is a
//! change like any other, so the watcher reports it too.
//!
//! Dropping the watch tells the thread to stop and waits at most
//! [`STOP_WAIT`] for it. Nothing the thread does waits on the program
//! that copied (the pasteboard server holds what it serves), so a stop is
//! noticed within one poll and the thread ends with it; a read still
//! going when the wait passes is left to end on its own, as on Windows
//! and Linux, with Pane's fence already closed so what it reports then is
//! dropped. A panic while reading one change is caught and that report is
//! lost, and the thread goes on listening.
