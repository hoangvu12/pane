//! The clipboard history file, `clipboard-history.json`: every package's
//! history under its package identity's key, typed and versioned.
//!
//! ```json
//! { "version": 1, "packages": { "local:/…": {
//!     "capture": "on",
//!     "excluded": ["keepass.exe"],
//!     "retentionSeconds": 86400,
//!     "items": [{ "id": 7, "text": "hello", "copiedAt": 1790000000000, "source": "notepad.exe" }],
//!     "nextId": 8 } } }
//! ```
//!
//! Changes are made in memory under the store's lock and written after it
//! is released, so a copy never waits for another's write while holding it,
//! and a write never holds up a capture. Writes are made one at a time, and
//! a write older than the last one written is skipped, so the file always
//! ends with the latest state. A change is on disk once the call that made
//! it returns; a crash before that loses it (the file is replaced
//! atomically, so it holds the state before or after, never a torn one).
//!
//! Items expire: each is kept for its package's retention after it was
//! copied ([`PackageHistory::retention`]), by the store's [`Clock`]. Every
//! read and change first removes the expired items of every package (and
//! writes the file without them), so nothing expired is ever shown, counted
//! or kept again, whether the package ran meanwhile or not; and while Pane
//! runs, a thread of its own removes them when they expire
//! ([`HistoryStore::keep_expiring`]).
