//! The clipboard on Linux: the X11 `CLIPBOARD` selection, watched through
//! the XFIXES extension (`XfixesSelectSelectionInput`), which tells Pane's
//! own thread whenever any program takes the selection, without Pane owning
//! it and without a permission. A Wayland session has no X11 clipboard:
//! [`native`] says clipboard history is unavailable there.
//!
//! On each change the thread, and only it, asks the new owner what it
//! offers (`TARGETS`), then for what was copied (`ConvertSelection`, into a
//! property of a window of Pane's own): the files a file manager copied
//! (`text/uri-list`, every `file://` URI), else the text — first as
//! `UTF8_STRING`, then, if the owner refuses that, as `STRING` (Latin-1) —
//! else an image (`image/png`; #167). An owner that does not answer
//! `TARGETS` is asked for the text alone, as before. What the owner sends
//! in pieces (`INCR`) is read piece by piece, and abandoned once it is
//! larger than Pane keeps ([`MAX_TEXT_BYTES`] for text, [`MAX_IMAGE_BYTES`]
//! for an image). What is kept is decided by `clipboard::accept`, the same
//! on every system. X11
//! has no formats that mark a copy as not to be kept: the markers are
//! reported as [`Markers::default`] and only a program the user excluded is
//! skipped, matched by the owner window's process, which `_NET_WM_PID` and
//! `/proc` name (or its `WM_CLASS`, which usually is the program's name);
//! a copy made by a window that says neither is never excluded.
//!
//! Writing ([`ClipboardSystem::write_text`], and an image or files with
//! [`ClipboardSystem::write_image`] and [`ClipboardSystem::write_files`])
//! takes the selection with a window of Pane's own, which serves what was
//! written to whoever pastes, as a
//! program that copied does, until another program copies; a write is a
//! change like any other, so the watcher reports it too. When Pane stops,
//! the server offers the selection to the clipboard manager, as the ICCCM
//! says an owner should, so what Pane put stays pasteable where a manager
//! runs (without one, every program's copy goes with it).
//!
//! Dropping the watch tells the thread to stop and waits at most
//! [`STOP_WAIT`] for it. A read that is still waiting on the program that
//! copied is left to end on its own, as on Windows; unlike there it always
//! does, because every wait while reading is bounded, and Pane dropped the
//! sink's fence before, so what a late read returns is dropped.
