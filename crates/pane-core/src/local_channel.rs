//! The local channel: how `pane-ext dev` reaches the running Pane (ADR 0047,
//! #217).
//!
//! Pane listens on an endpoint of the user it runs as, which no other user
//! can open:
//!
//! - On Windows, the named pipe `\\.\pipe\pane-<the user's SID>`, whose
//!   protected security descriptor lets only that user open it, and which
//!   refuses clients on other computers.
//! - On macOS and Linux, the Unix-domain socket `channel` in a folder of the
//!   user's own: `pane` in the user's runtime folder (`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`),
//!   else `pane-<uid>` in the temporary folder (per user on macOS). The
//!   folder is the user's alone (mode 0700; Pane does not listen in one that
//!   is not), the socket is mode 0600, and a connection from another user is
//!   closed unanswered.
//!
//! [`ENDPOINT_VARIABLE`] names another endpoint, for tests and for a second
//! Pane in development.
//!
//! What is said on it is JSON, one object a line. `pane-ext` sends
//! [`Request`]s, each with the channel's [`VERSION`]; Pane answers with
//! [`Event`]s. A connection develops one package folder:
//!
//! 1. `subscribe` asks for the package's development status and extension
//!    log, as `log` events, from the moment Pane develops it.
//! 2. `develop` hands over a build of the folder, staged in a folder of
//!    `pane-ext`'s. If Pane has not installed the folder, it shows its
//!    ordinary install preview of it, with this build, which the author
//!    confirms in Pane (`previewing`). Pane then develops the package (see
//!    `Launcher::develop_remotely`): it answers `developing` once the
//!    package runs that build, or `refused` saying why not. Each later
//!    `develop` reloads the package from its build.
//! 3. `building` and `failed` tell Pane of `pane-ext`'s later builds, so that
//!    Pane shows them as it shows its own.
//! 4. `stop`, or the connection closing (`pane-ext` stopped with Ctrl+C),
//!    ends the development, as Stop developing does.
//!
//! Pane sends `build` when the author asks it to build the package again,
//! and `ended` when the development ends otherwise: stopped in Pane, the
//! package disabled or uninstalled, or Pane quitting.
