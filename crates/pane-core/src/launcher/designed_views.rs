//! The designed view a command opens as its own screen (`"mode":
//! "designed"`, ADR 0036): a tree of layout nodes and UI components the
//! extension describes and Pane renders (`docs/designed-tree.md`).
//!
//! Opening the command calls the component's `open-view` once — passing its
//! launch record, as every launch does — and draws the view's first tree;
//! it never calls `render`. Pressing a button the tree named (`onPress`)
//! sends the press to the view's `handle-event`, with the sequence number
//! of the tree the user saw, and then asks for the tree again: the whole
//! screen is redrawn from the answer, the extension's state living in the
//! view's resource. Events are delivered one at a time, in order, exactly
//! as a custom view's are: an answer to an event older than another
//! already on screen is dropped, never replacing the newer tree, and an
//! answer for a view the user has left finds the screen gone and is
//! dropped with it.
//!
//! The screen holds a **navigation stack** (#239): the root view the
//! command opened, and each view a view's answer pushed above it
//! (`outcome.push`), the top of the stack on screen. A view's answer may
//! also replace itself (`outcome.replace`), or pop itself with a result
//! (`outcome.pop`); the back key pops the top view whatever answered,
//! showing the view below's last tree at once — no guest call first — and
//! then telling that view the one above it popped, the pop event, with
//! the result when the pop was the view's own. Popped and replaced views
//! are dropped in the runtime, never used again. The back key, the
//! `window::pop-to-root` host function and Shift+Esc drop the whole stack,
//! leaving the command as leaving its list does; a stack deeper than
//! [`MAX_NAVIGATION_DEPTH`](crate::runtime::MAX_NAVIGATION_DEPTH) refuses a
//! further push as the extension's error, the view keeping its last good
//! tree.
//!
//! An error the extension answers with — a failure of the call itself, a
//! tree Pane cannot read, over a limit, or of another major version of the
//! component set — is shown on the screen while the view stays open with
//! its last good tree. A crash closes it, as it closes a custom view.
//!
//! An event is raised on the tree the user saw (#238): the window's
//! controls carry the render they were drawn from, and an event raised on
//! a node the user could see is delivered even if the view has rendered
//! since — while the view holds no render more than one past it (the two
//! the SDKs keep) and the node with that key still names a handler of the
//! event's kind; otherwise the event is dropped, and reported in the
//! extension's log while its package is developed. The same log holds a
//! developed package's key problems (keys shared by siblings, stateful
//! nodes without one), reported by the runtime as it reads each tree.
//!
//! A render's answer may also ask Pane to draw the view again after some
//! milliseconds (`refresh-after-ms`, #236): the refresh thread (see
//! `refresh`) sends that drawing numbered with these events, at most one
//! at a time, only while the view is on top and the launcher is shown.
