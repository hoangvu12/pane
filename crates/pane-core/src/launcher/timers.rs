//! Timers extensions registered at run time (#158): `after` (one firing)
//! and `every` (one every interval), from 1 second to 30 days, each firing
//! a call into the component's `events` export with the timer's tag.
//!
//! A timer is an owned registration the guest holds: its handle dropped,
//! its instance going or its generation ending ends it (see
//! `registrations`), and this thread stops firing it with the next look
//! the registry's hooks wake it to. The timer belongs to the generation
//! of the code that registered it: each firing is a guest call of it,
//! stopped by a disable, a reload, an update, an uninstall or a pause,
//! and a trap in it is a crash of the package like any call's, counted
//! towards pausing it.
//!
//! Firings are coalesced, never replayed: firings that fall due while one
//! is pending, or while the package waits for what it needs (none of its
//! code runs then), are one firing, delivered when the pending one
//! answers or the package can run again. An `every` timer's interval then
//! begins again at that firing; an `after` timer fires once.
//!
//! The thread follows the launcher's clock (the system's, or the one a
//! test or a development build gives), as the scheduler does: it wakes
//! when a firing is due, when the clock is set other than by time
//! passing, when a package's generation changes and when the registry
//! changes.
