//! Automatic updates of installed packages from npm and Git: Pane
//! replaces the managed copy of an eligible npm package with a compatible
//! newer version from its registry, and of an eligible Git package with
//! the newer commit of the tracked branch it was installed from, without
//! the user asking (US72–US75, T15).
//!
//! The updater is a thread of Pane's own, shaped like the scheduler's and
//! the services thread's, driven by the launcher's clock: it checks a
//! minute after Pane starts — never competing with Pane's own start — and
//! then every
//! [`CHECK_EVERY`](CHECK_EVERY) hours, in the background, so the window
//! never waits for the registry or the repository. A check reads only the
//! metadata — the registry's for an npm package, the repository's
//! reference listing for a Git one; nothing is downloaded while the
//! latest version is the version installed, or the tracked branch points
//! at the commit installed. A newer version or commit is fetched and
//! checked exactly as an install checks a package (its manifest and API,
//! its components, its platforms and helpers, and its dependencies as a
//! plan), and what was downloaded stays staged until it is applied.
//!
//! Applying a staged update waits for the safe activation boundary: no
//! screen of the package is on display (a command, its search, a form or
//! a custom view — a call the user is waiting on runs with one open), and
//! no call of it the user asked for is running (see
//! [`Runtime::busy`](crate::Runtime::busy)). The user is never
//! interrupted mid-command; the update is tried again every
//! [`RETRY_EVERY`](RETRY_EVERY) seconds until the package is quiet.
//! Managed background work (a scheduled run, a service cycle) is not
//! waited for: a replacement ends it with the package's generation and
//! the new code starts it again, exactly as a reload does. Applying the
//! update is an update as the preview's Update row is: the identity, the
//! saved data, the disabled state, the hotkeys and the aliases are kept,
//! and the old code's generation ends, stopping what is still pending
//! with its late answer discarded.
//!
//! Which packages are eligible: installed from npm and not pinned (a
//! pinned version is kept, whatever the latest is), or installed from Git
//! and tracked (a tag or commit named to install it is pinned and kept,
//! and an update follows the branch), and in either case enabled, not
//! paused after a failure, and not turned off — the user's controls are a
//! global choice and a per-package one (rows in the extension list,
//! recorded in `updates.json` beside `installed.json`). A local folder's
//! or a development copy's code is never replaced here: only npm and Git
//! packages update by themselves. A check or an update that fails is
//! recorded, and the installed copy is left as it is.
//!
//! **The results.** Each pass records what it came to per package, as
//! Pane's own record beside `updates.json` (`update-results.json`, see
//! `update_results`): a package the pass does not look at is skipped with
//! why, a check or an update that fails is recorded as failed — and a
//! failure is announced once, the next time the launcher is shown —
//! while a successful update is quiet, its outcome the record itself,
//! which the results screen shows. The status-line messages a single
//! background update once set are replaced by that.
//!
//! **Provisional, pending the user's decision:** the cadence (a check a
//! minute after Pane starts, then every 24 hours, by the launcher's
//! clock), the retry
//! every second while a package is in use, and that a disabled or paused
//! package is not updated (updating a paused one would unpause it, which
//! is the user's choice to make).
