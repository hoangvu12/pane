//! Pane's crash record in the launcher (#133): after a run ended
//! unexpectedly, root search lists one root result, "Pane quit unexpectedly
//! last time", whose action opens the logs folder with the system's file
//! manager — the way the application update's row works (#54), a row in
//! root search and a word on the status line, with no new UI element.
//! Settings' About page shows the same notice ([`Launcher::log_notice`]).
//!
//! The notice goes when the user dismisses it (the row's Actions panel
//! entry, [`Launcher::dismiss_crash_notice`]), opens the folder, or Pane
//! next quits cleanly and starts again: it is only ever made at start, from
//! the markers `crate::diagnostics` found. A clean quit
//! ([`Launcher::quit_cleanly`]) removes this run's marker.
