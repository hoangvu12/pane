//! The extensions' operations that Pane's Settings window runs (#168, ADR
//! 0043): from each installed package's switch, reload, update, cache and
//! uninstall to the hotkeys, choices, development and retained data, read
//! as typed operations ([`Launcher::extension_operations`]: what each is,
//! whose, and whether it is on) and run one at a time
//! ([`Launcher::run_extension_operation`]) without moving the launcher off
//! the screen the user had open. The confirmations and details screens an
//! operation opens are the launcher's own screens, which Settings draws and
//! answers; once answered, the launcher returns to root search. The
//! launcher window has no screen for the extensions: its "Manage
//! Extensions" command opens Settings at them. The list the operations
//! come from can still be shown as a screen of its own for the tests
//! ([`Launcher::manage_extensions`]).
//!
//! Also here: turning one command of a package on or off, checking a
//! package for an update and the folder its page shows.
