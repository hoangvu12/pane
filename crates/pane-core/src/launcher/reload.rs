//! Reloading one installed package while Pane and other packages keep
//! running (ADR 0004).
//!
//! A reload has two stages, reported differently:
//!
//! 1. The package is read again from its source folder and checked as an
//!    install would check it, without running it. If that fails, nothing
//!    changes: the installed code stays in use and the reason is shown.
//! 2. Otherwise the checked package replaces the managed copy, the old
//!    instances stop, and the replacement starts: each of its commands
//!    available here is started and asked for its view. If one fails to
//!    initialize (a trap, or a component that cannot load or be
//!    instantiated; not an error the guest answers with), its instances
//!    are stopped again and the package is paused as failed to start
//!    (see `pausing`), with Retry; the older code is not restored.
//!
//! The old code hands its in-memory state to the new one when it opted in
//! (ADR 0041's state handoff, #159), and the command screen that was open
//! is reopened on the new code with its launch record, whether or not the
//! package opted in: `take_handoff`/`stage_handoff` and `take_reopen`/
//! [`Launcher::reopen`] below, which an update the user chose runs too.
//!
//! Settings belong to the package identity, so they are kept throughout.
