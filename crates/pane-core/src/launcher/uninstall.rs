//! Uninstalling one installed package, with the user's explicit choice to
//! keep or delete its saved data (its extension settings and content).
//!
//! Choosing a row of the confirmation applies at once in this launcher: the
//! package leaves root search, the extension list and the operation
//! targets, its instances stop, an open command of it closes and it can no
//! longer save data. Then Pane, never the package's code:
//!
//! 1. records it as uninstalled in `installed.json`, with a record of the
//!    identity whose saved data is kept when the user keeps it. If this
//!    fails nothing else changes and the package is back as it was. This is
//!    the point after which the package is uninstalled;
//! 2. removes its managed copy. A folder still in use (Windows) is listed
//!    for removal at the next start, as an update's replaced copy is;
//! 3. removes its cache and local credentials, and its settings and content
//!    too when the user deletes them. Data that could not be removed stays
//!    recorded as kept, so it is not lost track of.
//!
//! Recording first means a failure leaves either an installed package with
//! all its data or an uninstalled one whose leftovers are on record, never
//! an installed package whose data was deleted. A failure of step 2 or 3 is
//! explained rather than reported as a
//! successful uninstall. The source folder and anything outside Pane's data
//! folder are never touched. Kept data belongs to the package identity:
//! installing the same source again finds it, another source never does.
