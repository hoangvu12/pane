//! Installing or updating a package from a folder with the required
//! dependencies it is missing (see `dependencies`), exactly as the preview
//! showed them.
//!
//! The preview's plan travels with its Install row as the plan's
//! [`Assumptions`]. Choosing the row claims, at once, the requested package
//! and every package the plan relies on ([`Changing::Installing`]), after
//! checking that they are still as the plan found them: until the install
//! ends, uninstalling, deleting the retained data of, reloading, updating,
//! enabling, disabling or starting to develop any of them is refused, and a
//! development build of one waits to reload it. The install then reads the
//! folders and works the plan out again; if it differs from the preview's
//! (a folder changed, or a package was installed or changed meanwhile),
//! nothing is installed and the new plan is shown. An install without a
//! preview ([`Launcher::install_package`]) plans, then claims the same way
//! before installing anything.
