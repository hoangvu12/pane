//! Pausing an installed package that keeps failing (#16), so one broken
//! extension does not fail again and again while the rest of Pane runs.
//!
//! Pane pauses a package when a failure is attributable to it: its code ran
//! in this package's current generation and failed on its own.
//!
//! - **It could not start**: a component could not be loaded or
//!   instantiated, or its reloaded code trapped as it started (a startup
//!   failure). Paused at once: starting it again would fail the same way.
//! - **It crashed [`CRASHES_BEFORE_PAUSE`] times within
//!   [`CRASH_WINDOW`]**: a guest call trapped, whether the user ran it
//!   (opening a command, an action, a form, a view event or closing a view),
//!   root search asked it for results, or another package called its
//!   operation. Calls that answer in between do not start the count again
//!   (opening a command before each crashing action answers); crashes
//!   further apart than the window, and those before Pane started or the
//!   package's generation began, are not counted together.
//! - **It stopped responding** (#18): a guest call computed for the
//!   runtime's compute limit without finishing and was stopped. Wasmtime
//!   was running that package's code, so the failure is its own, and it
//!   counts as a crash does, in the same window (provisional). A package
//!   started from a guest that stops responding as it starts could not
//!   start.
//!
//! What is not a failure of the package: an error the extension answers
//! with ("sign in first"), which is an ordinary outcome; a call stopped
//! because its generation, or a caller's in its chain, ended (disable,
//! reload, update, uninstall), even though its instance restarts afresh
//! afterwards as after a crash; and Pane's own runtime being unavailable. A
//! crash of a package serving an operation is its own, not its caller's. An
//! unattributed failure of the runtime itself (#17) pauses nothing.
//!
//! A paused package's generation ends, which stops its pending calls and
//! drops its instances; its commands stay listed in root search, saying why
//! they do not run, and it computes no root results and serves no
//! operations. Its settings and saved data are kept. The pause is recorded
//! with the package's version and managed copy, so it holds after a restart
//! for that code. It ends with Retry (which starts the same code again),
//! a reload or an update (new code), disabling or enabling the package (it
//! starts afresh) or uninstalling it.
