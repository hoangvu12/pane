//! Development mode: building a local package after each save and reloading
//! it (ADR 0004; #12, #13).
//!
//! The author turns it on for one installed, enabled package in Manage
//! extensions. Pane then watches the package's source folder with the
//! system's file watcher. After a save (and a short pause, so that an
//! editor's several writes are one save) it runs the package's build (see
//! `crate::develop`), which puts the package's components in a staging
//! folder of its own under Pane's data folder:
//!
//! - A build that fails replaces nothing: the package keeps running its
//!   installed code, and the diagnostics are shown ("Why <title> did not
//!   build"), with the whole output in a log file under Pane's data folder.
//! - A build that succeeds is reloaded from its staging folder exactly as
//!   the Reload row reloads the source folder (`reload`): checked as an
//!   install, then replacing the managed copy and starting; a start that
//!   fails pauses the package with Retry, and the earlier code is not
//!   restored. Its components are then also copied to the source folder, so
//!   a later Reload reloads the same build.
//! - A save while a build runs makes that build obsolete: it runs to its end
//!   but is never reloaded, and the folder is built again. Builds of one
//!   package run one at a time, and each reload ends before the next build
//!   starts, so an older build never replaces a newer one. The components
//!   an obsolete build left in the source folder (a Rust build's `target`)
//!   are replaced with the installed ones, so a Reload never picks it up.
//!   After [`MAX_OBSOLETE`] obsolete builds in a row, Pane waits for the
//!   next save.
//! - A build that ends while the package is being changed otherwise (a
//!   Reload, an update) waits for that change to end; a save meanwhile
//!   makes it obsolete.
//!
//! Development ends when the author stops it, when the package is disabled
//! or uninstalled, and when the launcher goes: its watcher is dropped and a
//! running build is stopped with every process it started, before the call
//! that ends it returns. A build that ends after that is dropped without a
//! word. Development is not recorded, so it also ends when Pane quits.
//! Nothing else changes: another installed copy of the same package
//! (another source) is never built, reloaded, disabled or swapped for this
//! one.
//!
//! Once on, any write to the folder (an editor's autosave, `git pull`, a
//! sync client) runs the build, including a Rust package's `build.rs` and
//! the tools its build runs, with the author's own rights and Pane's
//! environment. That is what the author asked for by developing the
//! package, for this session only.
