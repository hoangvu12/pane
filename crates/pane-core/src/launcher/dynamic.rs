//! Dynamic root items: what extensions registered at run time (#158),
//! as root search lists them. The registry (`crate::registrations`) keeps
//! what the guests registered; this module turns the root item entries
//! into root search's rows, ranked like indexed results, and keeps the
//! looks their rows draw.
//!
//! A dynamic root item is under one of the package's commands, in the
//! item shape of docs/list-tree.md plus the `mode` that makes it a
//! **dynamic command**: without one, invoking its row runs its first
//! action's callback, delivered to the command's event entry point
//! (`handle-event`); with one, invoking it launches its command with a
//! launch record naming the item's id (its `context`), so one component
//! can offer a row per workspace, or whatever it registered. A quick
//! slot, an alias or a global hotkey holds it by its command and item
//! id, and while it is not registered says so, as one of a missing
//! indexed result does.
//!
//! A row appears when the item is registered and disappears when it is
//! dropped, its instance goes or its generation ends: the registry's
//! hooks refresh root search. A package that waits keeps its items
//! listed, saying what the package needs, as its commands' rows do.
