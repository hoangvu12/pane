//! The standard List and Grid of a designed view (#240): the items a
//! view's tree names, in sections, whose search field and selection Pane
//! owns. The List document's vocabulary rides the designed tree — an item
//! has a key, a title, a subtitle, an icon, accessories and the actions
//! that activate it — and the host does what it does for a command's own
//! list: it filters the items by the text typed in the view's search field
//! (the root-search matcher, `crate::search`, unless the view handles the
//! search itself, its `onSearchText` then hearing the text through the
//! view's events, throttled by the window), keeps the selection on an
//! item by its key, raises a load-more as the selection nears the end of
//! what the tree shows while it says more is there, and fills the
//! launcher's rows with the items as it fills them for a command's list —
//! so the window draws them with the launcher's own list, virtualised,
//! accessible, selected and moved through by the same keys.
//!
//! The view's search field is the search header's (the navigation title
//! moves into the header with the List, #239's interim footer title
//! replaced): `Launcher::set_query` sets the list's text, and
//! [`crate::Screen::search_field`] names it, so the window's query field
//! shows and edits it as it does root search's. The text is partially
//! controlled: a `searchText` the tree names wins when it differs from
//! the value its previous render named and from every value the field
//! reported, so an echo of what the user typed never fights typing.
//!
//! The presentation is recomputed whenever the screen's state changes —
//! a tree landing, the search text, the selection — into the snapshot's
//! [`DesignedList`], which carries what the rows do not: the search, the
//! loading state and when it began (the loading bar's 300 ms threshold),
//! the sections' labels, the empty view's and the detail pane's subtrees
//! (the selected item's `detail`, built for it through the render
//! context's `selected`), the search-bar dropdown, and the Grid's shapes.
//! A view names at most one list or grid — the first in its tree, in
//! document order; a later one draws as a plain column of its rows, as
//! any other node's children do.
