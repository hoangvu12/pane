//! The forms Pane itself asks the user, as designed trees (#241): the
//! argument form (#144), the Setup screen (#143), the alias form, and the
//! npm and Git install forms. Every form an extension asks is a designed
//! tree too now — its fields are the tree's field components and its
//! submission an event — so Pane's own forms are what they always were,
//! drawn by the same renderer through the same keyed reconciler, with one
//! difference: no extension answers their submission. The tree's `form`
//! node names no `onSubmit`; the window collects the fields' values (as
//! it collects an extension form's) and hands them to
//! [`Launcher::submit_pane_form`], which does what the open form's
//! purpose does: the argument form launches its command, the Setup screen
//! saves its preferences and launches, the alias form applies at once, the
//! npm and Git forms preview the package they name.
//!
//! What each purpose shows is built here as a tree: one `form` node whose
//! children are the fields — a text field, a password field, a dropdown,
//! a path field with the system's picker, a checkbox — each with its
//! `title`, `placeholder` and `info`, and the form's `submitLabel`. A
//! required argument or preference that is empty asks for the keyboard
//! (`focus`), so the form opens with it; a submission that leaves one
//! empty sets its `error` and asks for it again, moving the keyboard
//! there. What a discrete control chooses (a dropdown's option, a
//! checkbox's state) is told to [`Launcher::pane_form_changed`], which
//! moves it into the tree the screen holds, exactly as an extension's
//! change event moves it into the tree its answer holds.
