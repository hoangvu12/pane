//! The choice of a collection's extensions (#308, ADR 0044). A Git
//! repository — or local folder — whose root holds `pane-collection.json`
//! is a collection, and naming it, without an extension's id, opens the
//! choice: the extensions it offers, each listed with what its own
//! manifest says of it (its icon, title, description and version; the
//! index holds none of those), none ticked. The user ticks some or all of
//! them — Space and the row's check mark tick the selected extension, the
//! arrows move the selection as any list's — and chooses Install: each
//! ticked extension is then previewed and installed as any extension's
//! own install is, one after another, in the collection's order, with its
//! own identity, managed copy and record.
//!
//! Choosing several is a convenience, never a unit (ADR 0044): one that
//! cannot be installed is explained and the others continue, and when the
//! run ends the choice lists what was installed and what was not.
//! Nothing of the choice itself is recorded. Activating an extension's
//! row opens the ordinary preview of that one extension, whose Back
//! returns to the choice, before anything is installed.
//!
//! For a collection fetched from Git, the revision Pane fetched is held
//! while the choice is open: every extension is previewed and installed
//! from that one revision, so however many are ticked, the revision is
//! fetched once.
