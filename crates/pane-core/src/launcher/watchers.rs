//! Folder watchers extensions registered at run time (#158): a path,
//! recursive or not, watched through the native watcher development mode
//! uses (inotify, FSEvents, ReadDirectoryChangesW), each change delivered
//! to the component's `events` export with the watcher's tag and the
//! paths that changed, relative to the watched folder. An overflow — too
//! many changes were lost — is one "rescan" event.
//!
//! A watcher is an owned registration the guest holds: its handle
//! dropped, its instance going or its generation ending ends it (see
//! `registrations`), and the native watcher stops with the next look the
//! registry's hooks wake this thread to. A package that waits for what it
//! needs runs none of its code, so its watchers' changes are held and
//! merged, and delivered when it can run again.
//!
//! Changes are coalesced: those arriving within half a second of the
//! first are one event, whose paths are the union of them, sorted and
//! without repetition. The thread takes what the native watchers report
//! on their own thread — which only sends here — and the registry's
//! changes through its hooks, and delivers each event on a thread of its
//! own, so a slow guest delays neither the window nor the next event.
