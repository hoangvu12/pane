//! Which installed packages wait for a required dependency or a required
//! capability that cannot serve them, and why: the waiting commands of
//! #151 (ADR 0041), on the dependencies `pane.json` already declares
//! (#152) and the capabilities it declares under `uses` (#156).
//!
//! A command of an enabled, unpaused package waits while one of its
//! package's required dependencies is missing, disabled, paused or waiting
//! itself, or while a required capability of its package has no provider
//! that is installed, enabled, not paused and not waiting. An optional
//! dependency or capability never makes a command wait, nor does a
//! dependency the package needs only on other systems, nor a use that
//! declares `"use": "all"`: a call to every provider degrades to an empty
//! list instead. A use narrowed with `commands` gates only those commands:
//! the package's other commands stay available, and only the narrowed
//! commands wait.
//!
//! Who waits is computed as a greatest fixed point over the manifests and
//! the packages' states ([`Waiting::of`]): every enabled, unpaused package
//! starts as able to run, and any package with an unmet requirement is
//! removed, repeating until nothing changes. A cycle of healthy packages
//! runs; a cycle with one member missing waits as a whole. A capability a
//! waiting package provides does not count as provided, so its own
//! consumers wait in turn, and a provider that is also a consumer of the
//! same capability never serves itself: it waits until another provider
//! can serve.
//!
//! What a waiting command does not do is the launcher's, told by
//! `State::recheck_waiting` recomputing this whenever the packages or their
//! pauses change: a waiting command's view, run entry point, actions,
//! arguments and setup screen do not run, its schedule's ticks are skipped
//! and not replayed, its service does not cycle, and root search does not
//! ask for its root or indexed results. Waiting ends no generation and
//! stops no instance: a call or cycle already running finishes, and an
//! open screen stays. It never counts towards pausing. A package waiting
//! as a whole answers its published operations `unavailable`, naming what
//! it waits for.
//!
//! When the requirement is met again — the dependency is enabled, retried,
//! installed, or its package is reloaded or updated, or a provider of the
//! capability can serve again — the waiting map is recomputed the same way
//! and the command comes back by itself.
//!
//! The wording lives here, as the dependency plan's does (see
//! `dependencies`): the map is data.
