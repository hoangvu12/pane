//! The session and power commands on Windows (see the parent module):
//! each decision the parent makes is carried out through a documented
//! Windows API. The privilege a session-ending call needs is enabled for
//! that call alone and put back as it was after.
//!
//! - **Lock Screen**: `LockWorkStation`.
//! - **Log Out, Restart, Shut Down**: `ExitWindowsEx` with a planned
//!   reason (`SHTDN_REASON_FLAG_PLANNED`, an application's maintenance),
//!   `EWX_FORCE` — applications closed without the chance to save — for
//!   a restart and a shutdown only, as the user chose (ADR 0040), and the
//!   shutdown privilege (`SeShutdownPrivilege`) enabled around the call.
//! - **Sleep, Hibernate**: `SetSuspendState`, or the displays'
//!   monitor-power message on a computer that enters Modern Standby when
//!   they turn off.
//! - **Volume Up, Volume Down, Toggle Mute, Set Volume**: Core Audio: the
//!   default output endpoint's `IAudioEndpointVolume`, its level set as a
//!   scalar of 100 and its mute set with it.
//! - **Toggle Microphone Mute**: the active capture endpoints, each
//!   reached through its own `IAudioEndpointVolume` to set its mute.
//! - **Turn Off Displays, Start Screen Saver**: a `WM_SYSCOMMAND`
//!   (`SC_MONITORPOWER` or `SC_SCREENSAVE`) sent with `SendMessageTimeoutW`
//!   to a hidden window of Pane's own, never a broadcast that a hung
//!   application could block; Windows' own procedure (`DefWindowProcW`)
//!   turns the command into what it does. A screen saver that is off in
//!   Windows' settings (`SPI_GETSCREENSAVEACTIVE`) is explained rather
//!   than started.
//! - **What the computer can do**: `GetPwrCapabilities`, whose `AoAc`
//!   says the computer enters Modern Standby when its displays turn off,
//!   and whose `HiberFilePresent` says there is a hibernation file.
//! - **Open Recycle Bin, Empty Recycle Bin**: the Recycle Bin's known
//!   folder (`SHGetKnownFolderPath`) opened through the shell
//!   (`ShellExecuteExW`); `SHQueryRecycleBinW` says what the bin holds,
//!   so an already empty one is answered as a success, and
//!   `SHEmptyRecycleBinW` empties it with no confirmation of its own
//!   (the command asked first), no progress window and no sound.
//! - **Toggle System Appearance**: the personalization values
//!   (`AppsUseLightTheme`, `SystemUsesLightTheme`) read and written
//!   together through the registry, followed by a `WM_SETTINGCHANGE`
//!   broadcast naming the colour setting, sent with `SendMessageTimeoutW`
//!   and the abort-if-hung flag, so that a hung application cannot block
//!   it.
//! - **Toggle HDR**: the display configuration's advanced colour state:
//!   `QueryDisplayConfig` for the active paths, `DisplayConfigGetDeviceInfo`
//!   for whether a display supports and is showing advanced colour, and
//!   `DisplayConfigSetDeviceInfo` to turn it on or off.
//! - **Show Desktop**: the shell's own `ToggleDesktop` (`IShellDispatch4`).
//! - **Toggle Hidden Files**: File Explorer's `Hidden` value in its
//!   `Advanced` key, read and written, followed by the refreshing of
//!   every open Explorer window through the shell's windows collection
//!   (`IShellWindows`, each window's `Refresh`).
//! - **Eject Removable Drives**: each removable drive's volume is locked
//!   (`FSCTL_LOCK_VOLUME`) and dismounted (`FSCTL_DISMOUNT_VOLUME`), then
//!   the disk behind it — found by the device number the volume and the
//!   disk-drive class both answer — is ejected through the configuration
//!   manager (`CM_Request_Device_EjectW`).
//! - **Toggle Bluetooth**: the radios API: `BluetoothFindFirstRadio` and
//!   `BluetoothFindNextRadio` find the radios,
//!   `BluetoothEnumerateInstalledServices` says whether the radio's
//!   provider service is enabled (which is the radio being on), and
//!   `BluetoothSetServiceState` enables or disables it for the radio's
//!   own address, which turns the radio on or off.
