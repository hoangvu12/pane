//! Reading the zip of Pane's Windows package, which an application update
//! downloads ([#54](https://github.com/hoangvu12/pane/issues/54)).
//!
//! A Windows user unzips Pane's package with whatever is at hand —
//! Explorer, `Expand-Archive`, any unzip — and Windows has no tar a user
//! can rely on, so the Windows package is a zip ([`xtask`'s zip
//! writer](../../../xtask/src/zip.rs) documents why it is written by hand
//! rather than through a library). An application update installs that
//! same package, so Pane reads it here, as strictly as it reads an npm
//! package's tarball ([`crate::npm::unpack`]): only files and folders,
//! each path inside the package and one plain name on every system, and
//! the whole archive within the same bounds. What each entry says about
//! itself is checked twice — once in the central directory, once in the
//! file's own local header — so no two readers can see different files in
//! one zip, and every file's bytes are checked against the CRC32 its
//! entry names, as every unzip does.
//!
//! Only what Pane's own packaging writes is accepted: entries stored or
//! deflated (method 0 or 8), no encryption, no zip64, no data
//! descriptors, no extra fields. A zip that says anything else is
//! explained and refused rather than guessed at, because a wrong guess
//! here installs a wrong program.
