//! The launcher model: the public host interface driven by the native window
//! and by tests alike.
//!
//! Every user action is a method on [`Launcher`]; [`Launcher::view`] returns a
//! snapshot of what the window should show. Actions that call into an
//! extension update the snapshot immediately (for example to "running") and
//! return a future that applies the extension's reply when awaited.
//!
//! Every reply is checked against the screen it was requested from: once the
//! user has left that screen, the reply is discarded, and a custom view that
//! opened after the user left is closed again.
//!
//! A call into an installed package also belongs to the package's
//! generation current when the user asked for it (see `generation`):
//! disabling, reloading or updating the package ends it, which stops the call
//! in the runtime, and its answer is never shown, even on a screen that is
//! still current. Leaving a screen only discards its replies; it does not
//! stop the call. So does pausing a package that keeps failing (see
//! `pausing`). The one exception is root search's own calls for results
//! computed from the query: a search owns them, so a newer query, or
//! leaving root search, cancels those still pending.
//!
//! Scheduled work follows the same model (see `launcher/schedules`): a
//! command whose manifest declares a schedule runs its item's action every
//! interval while the package's code may run, each run a call into the
//! generation current when the scheduler asked for it. Continuing services
//! do too (see `launcher/services`): a command whose manifest declares one
//! runs its cycles while the package's code may run, at the cadence the
//! service itself answers with, each cycle a call into the generation
//! current when the services thread asked for it.
