//! Extension data: the values an installed package's commands save through
//! Pane, string values by key, of four kinds, each through its own
//! `pane:extension` interface (`wit/data.wit`), and the package's clipboard
//! history, which Pane keeps for it (`wit/clipboard.wit`, see `clipboard`).
//!
//! | Kind | File | Clear cache | Uninstall | Readable by |
//! |---|---|---|---|---|
//! | Settings | `settings.json` | kept | the user's choice | default |
//! | Content | `content.json` | kept | the user's choice | default |
//! | Cache | `cache.json`, `web-images/` | removed | removed | default |
//! | Local credentials | `credentials.json` | kept | removed | the user only (Unix: 0600); Windows: each value encrypted (DPAPI) |
//! | Clipboard history | `clipboard-history.json`, `clipboard-images/` | kept | the user's choice | the user only (Unix: 0600); Windows: each item's text encrypted (DPAPI) |
//!
//! On Windows the values of local credentials are written protected
//! (#130, see `protection`): the file is version 2, in which each value
//! records how it is protected, while package identities and keys stay
//! readable, so clearing the cache, uninstalling, deleting retained data and
//! the counts work without decrypting anything. A version-1 file an earlier
//! Pane wrote is converted when Pane starts, in one atomic write; if that
//! write fails, the file is read as it is and converted at the next start.
//! A value that cannot be decrypted on this computer is explained to the
//! extension that reads it and counted as unreadable, never dropped or
//! replaced but by the extension's own `set`. The other kinds' files, and
//! local credentials on macOS and Linux, stay at version 1.
//!
//! Each kind has one file next to `installed.json`, holding every package's
//! values under the package identity's key, so they belong to the source
//! identity rather than the title or the managed copy. The web images a
//! package's icons name (#142) are cache too, downloaded by Pane into a
//! folder per package under `web-images/`. They are kept while
//! the package is disabled, updated or Pane is not running. The kind decides
//! what a management action removes, and removing is done here by Pane,
//! never by running the package. Deleting retained data (an uninstalled
//! package's kept data) removes every kind. An unreadable file is reported
//! to the guest and never overwritten.
//!
//! Files are written by a thread of their own, one write after another in
//! the order the changes were made, so the lock on the values is never held
//! while a file is written and synced (#18): the runtime thread only waits
//! for its write to finish, and a runtime thread Pane gave up on never holds
//! the lock the next one needs. A change is made in memory first; if its
//! write fails and nothing changed since, it is taken back.
