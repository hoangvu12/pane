//! The index of a collection: a repository — or folder — whose root holds
//! `pane-collection.json` rather than `pane.json`, listing the extensions it
//! offers, each by id and the folder holding it (ADR 0044). The id, not the
//! folder, names an extension, so moving a folder keeps its identity;
//! `renamed` maps an old id to its new one, or to `null` for one that was
//! removed, and is followed wherever an id is resolved (#310). The index
//! holds no titles or versions: each extension's own manifest carries
//! them, so the two cannot drift.
//!
//! The index is text the collection's author chose, so it is read within a
//! size limit, and everything of it that reaches an explanation is checked
//! first: an id is lowercase letters, digits and `-`, and a path is a plain
//! relative folder under the same name checks as a Git tree entry
//! ([`crate::downloads::check_part`]). A malformed index is refused saying
//! what is wrong with it, as a package's manifest is.
