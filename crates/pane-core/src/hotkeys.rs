//! Global hotkeys: a shortcut the user assigns to an installed command,
//! which opens that command in Pane's window even while another application
//! has focus.
//!
//! The launcher decides which shortcuts are bound and which should be
//! registered; the system is reached through one small trait, [`Hotkeys`],
//! with one adapter per system, chosen by [`native`]:
//!
//! - Windows: `RegisterHotKey` on a thread of Pane's own for the chords
//!   Windows accepts, and a low-level keyboard hook of Pane's own
//!   (`WH_KEYBOARD_LL`) for the chords Windows refuses — another
//!   application has the shortcut, or Windows keeps it — and for the
//!   binding kinds no registration can express: a lone tap or a double
//!   tap of a modifier, a side-specific modifier, a numpad key (#260) —
//!   so a refused shortcut is never an error ([`windows`], ADR 0039);
//! - macOS: Carbon's `RegisterEventHotKey`, through the `global-hotkey`
//!   crate, which needs no Accessibility permission ([`macos`]);
//! - Linux on X11: a passive key grab on the root window (`XGrabKey`)
//!   ([`X11Hotkeys`]). Wayland has no way for an application to watch keys
//!   pressed in other applications except the desktop portal's global
//!   shortcuts, which Pane does not use yet, so there the adapter explains
//!   that hotkeys are unavailable.
//!
//! An adapter reports each press of a registered shortcut to a
//! [`PressSender`]; the window reads them from the matching [`Presses`] and
//! asks the launcher to open the bound command. How a shortcut is
//! dispatched — the system's registration or Pane's keyboard hook — is the
//! adapter's to say ([`Hotkeys::route`]), and the binding's row shows it
//! ([`Route::note_on`]). The hook's own state is the adapter's to say
//! too ([`Hotkeys::hook_health`]), and the Settings pages and Copy
//! Diagnostics show it ([`HookHealth::note`]).
//!
//! The binding kinds #260 adds — the tap kinds, named sides, the extended
//! key set — work wherever the adapter has a hook to recognize them, which
//! is Windows; the other systems explain them ([`kinds_unavailable`]), so
//! a record copied from a Windows machine is not mysterious. A recorder
//! that listens asks the adapter for a recording session
//! ([`Hotkeys::recording`]), which holds the keys back from the system
//! while it lasts, so those kinds can be recorded without the system
//! acting on them (the Start menu the Windows key alone opens).
