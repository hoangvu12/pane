//! The host's live list of applications by identity (ADR 0038), kept in
//! front of a system adapter while a package that asked for it runs, so
//! that a guest asking for the installed applications gets them at once
//! after the first scan, the list stays current by itself, and every id,
//! current or from before identities, finds what opens it.
//!
//! The first [`Applications::installed`] scans on the calling thread and
//! starts a worker of the list's own, which watches the adapter's places
//! ([`Discovery::watch`]) and rescans:
//!
//! - once a reported change settles ([`DEBOUNCE`] after the last one, at
//!   most [`MOST_DEBOUNCE`] after the first), and again
//!   [`COMPLETING_AGAIN`] later for a change the system completes later;
//! - at once when the watcher lost changes or failed, and when the system
//!   seems to have slept (a wait that lasted far longer than it could);
//! - every reconciling period, whatever the watcher saw.
//!
//! Each rescan replaces the list by identity: an application whose last
//! source went stays listed for [`GRACE`] by the list's clock, and leaves
//! only if nothing with its identity came back meanwhile, so an update
//! that removes and reinstalls an application never makes it flicker out.
//! A failed rescan keeps the list. When the listed applications change,
//! [`Applications::on_change`]'s listeners are told.
//!
//! [`Applications::release`] (no package that asked can run any more)
//! drops the list and stops the worker and its watch; the next
//! [`Applications::installed`] starts again. Nothing is scanned or watched
//! before the first call, so a disabled Applications extension costs
//! nothing.
