//! The installed applications' own icons (#172, ADR 0038's "an icon
//! cache"): extracted by the host at 256 pixels, one adapter per system,
//! kept in Pane's cache folder, and refreshed in the background, so that
//! root search and quick slots draw each application's icon bare (ADR
//! 0035) without typing ever waiting for one.
//!
//! - **Extraction** ([`IconExtractor`], [`NativeExtractor`]): on Windows the
//!   shell's image of the application's primary source at 256 pixels,
//!   rejecting a small icon padded into a large canvas or framed in a
//!   thumbnail ([`covers_enough`]) for the next source (a shortcut's own
//!   icon location, its target program's shell image, then that program's
//!   own icon at its largest, the shell's file information icon); a
//!   packaged app's logo from its manifest, with its light and dark
//!   variants ([`appx`]). On macOS the workspace's icon of the bundle. On
//!   Linux the desktop entry's `Icon` in the user's icon theme, its parents
//!   and `hicolor`, then `pixmaps` ([`theme`]).
//! - **Filling its place** ([`fill_its_place`]): whatever extracted it, an
//!   image whose content spans less than three quarters of its canvas (a
//!   small picture padded into a large square, or framed: within a thin
//!   frame, the pixels unlike its transparent or light fill, [`frame`]) is
//!   cropped to the square around that content and scaled to
//!   [`ICON_SIZE`], so every application's icon is drawn as large as the
//!   others.
//! - **The cache** ([`IconCache`]): image files in Pane's cache folder
//!   ([`FOLDER`]), keyed by the application's id and a fingerprint of its
//!   source and of the file its picture is read from (each one's path, size
//!   and modification time, [`sources_fingerprint`]: a shortcut's icon
//!   location or else its target, a packaged app's logo, a bundle's icon
//!   file, a desktop entry's themed icon), each written atomically, with an
//!   index of them recording when each was extracted. An index that cannot
//!   be read is deleted with every image and rebuilt; one an earlier Pane
//!   wrote without extraction times is read with every picture old. Files
//!   the index does not name are removed. It holds at most [`MAX_BYTES`]
//!   and [`MAX_ICONS`], the least recently drawn going first. Deleting it
//!   loses nothing but the time to extract the icons again.
//! - **Refreshing**: one worker thread at low priority extracts a small
//!   batch at a time ([`BATCH`]). After each start it looks once at every
//!   listed application's icon and extracts it again only when it is
//!   missing, its fingerprint changed, or its picture is older than
//!   [`REFRESH_AGE`]; an icon a row on screen wants goes first, drawn from
//!   the cache at once when its fingerprint has not changed (an old one is
//!   then extracted again in the background) and extracted at once when it
//!   has. A failed extraction is remembered for the session, and the row
//!   keeps its placeholder (or the icon kept from before). Extraction never
//!   runs on the window's thread or the extension runtime's: asking what an
//!   icon shows only looks at what is kept.
