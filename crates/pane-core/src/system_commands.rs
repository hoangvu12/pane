//! The system's session and power commands, as a command reaches them
//! through Pane (`wit/system-commands.wit`, the Windows power features'
//! System Commands, #125, ADR 0040): locking the screen, logging out,
//! restarting, shutting down, sleeping, hibernating, turning the displays
//! off and starting the screen saver, and the audio commands: the volume
//! of the default output device (raising, lowering, setting or muting it)
//! and the microphones' mute.
//!
//! The decisions are here, as pure functions compiled on every system and
//! tested there: which commands force applications closed (a restart and
//! a shutdown do, a log out does not, the user's choice in ADR 0040),
//! which the extension confirms first, how `sleep` sleeps (a computer
//! that enters Modern Standby when its displays turn off is slept by
//! turning them off, so Windows enters its standby as it does by itself;
//! any other is suspended), whether `hibernate` can happen at all (only
//! with a hibernation file), how far a volume step moves the level, and
//! whether the microphone toggle mutes or unmutes (any microphone unmuted
//! means mute). [`run`] turns a decision into calls on the
//! [`SystemCommands`] trait, so an extension cannot get one wrong;
//! each call answers what it ended in ([`Outcome`]) — the state the
//! system is in now, or why nothing changed — never an error, and never a
//! reason to pause the extension.
//!
//! The launcher reaches the system through that one trait, given to it as
//! the system is ([`crate::Launcher::with_system_commands`]): the app
//! passes [`native`], tests a recording fake. A launcher given none
//! answers each command with [`none`]'s explanation. Each adapter is
//! called off the runtime's thread, so it may block for as long as the
//! system takes.
//!
//! - Windows: the documented APIs, in `system_commands/windows.rs`
//!   (`LockWorkStation`; `ExitWindowsEx` with a planned reason and the
//!   shutdown privilege enabled for the call alone; `SetSuspendState`;
//!   `GetPwrCapabilities`; monitor-power and screen-saver messages sent
//!   with a timeout to a window of Pane's own, never a broadcast; Core
//!   Audio's device enumerator and endpoint volume for the volume and
//!   microphone commands).
//! - macOS and Linux: [`native`] answers that the commands are not
//!   available there yet, which the System Commands default extension's
//!   `pane.json` keeps out of those systems' default sets.
