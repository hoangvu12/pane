//! The extension runtime: a Wasmtime engine that registers only WASI 0.3.
//!
//! The runtime owns every engine, store and guest instance on one dedicated
//! thread. Callers hold a cheap [`Runtime`] handle and await replies, so a slow
//! or failing guest never blocks the caller's thread.
//!
//! Calls are served one at a time. A call into an installed package belongs
//! to the package's generation (see `generation`): when it ends, a pending
//! call of it stops where the guest waits, and one queued behind is never
//! started. Component checks run on a checker thread of their own, so a
//! reload's check never waits behind the call it is about to stop.
