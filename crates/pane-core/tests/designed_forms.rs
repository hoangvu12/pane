//! The form a designed tree holds (#241), at the Launcher seam: a
//! submission carries the values of every field kind — the text a field
//! edits, the state a checkbox or toggle is in, the tags or paths a
//! picker chose — a validation error is the field's own in the next
//! render, and a `remember` field's last submitted value is kept as the
//! package's settings and prefilled onto the field the next time a view
//! opens holding it. The tri-lingual samples' "form" command answers
//! through an SDK, so its submission is checked by what the guest draws
//! back; the designed fixture's form is written by hand and draws the
//! payload Pane sent, so every field kind's value is observable as it
//! left Pane.
//!
//! Components come from `cargo xtask guests`; the JavaScript and
//! TypeScript ones are the prebuilt components in `guests/prebuilt/`.
