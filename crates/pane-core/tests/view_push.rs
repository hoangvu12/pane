//! A designed view pushing a re-render the moment its data arrives (#243,
//! the real-push slice of #121): the view's instance runs between Pane's
//! calls — the runtime keeps a guest that still has work going while one
//! of its designed views is open — so work a view's render started lands
//! in the background, and the view asks Pane to draw it again through
//! `pane:extension/view`. The drawing it asks for is sent numbered with
//! the view's events, at most one at a time, and a late answer never
//! replaces a newer tree: these checks hold the pushes against the
//! event answers, drop one that arrives after its view left, and draw a
//! view that pushes while another extension waits on a slow service —
//! drawn without waiting for it. The hand-written `designed` fixture asks
//! for pushes by hand (no SDK writes them), and the loading samples in
//! Rust, JavaScript and TypeScript show the loading helper's arrival
//! asking for a drawing itself: no timer, no clock to advance.
//!
//! Components come from `cargo xtask guests`; the JavaScript and
//! TypeScript ones are the prebuilt components in `guests/prebuilt/`.
