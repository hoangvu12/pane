//! Calling a capability by name through the launcher's public interface
//! (ADR 0041): a consumer in each language calls the provider in each
//! language by the capability's name, `pane-samples:greet@1`, rather than
//! by a package identity, and Pane routes each call to the provider that
//! can serve it — the first one installed — never the caller's own
//! package. Failures name the capability, and a package whose manifest
//! declares what it does not call is refused. The capability samples
//! (`guests/sample-greet*`, `guests/sample-capabilities*`) show what
//! authors write; the capabilities fixture (`guests/fixtures/capabilities`)
//! drives the refusals, chains, error kinds and the self-use rule. Real
//! guests from `cargo xtask guests`.
