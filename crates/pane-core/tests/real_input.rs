//! The front application and paste against Windows' real input (#253):
//! the Windows system adapter pastes into a window the test owns — a
//! form with a text field that a script of the test's runs in a process
//! of its own, since a window of the test's own process is never the
//! target — and the clipboard is put back, while a clipboard listener of
//! the test's own sees only writes tagged as not to be kept. A target
//! that is gone or not responding fails, saying so, with the text
//! staying on the clipboard, still tagged.
//!
//! The selected text (#262) is read the same way: through UI Automation
//! from a test-owned edit control with a selection and with none
//! ("nothing is selected", which is not a failure), and through the
//! simulated copy from a test-owned window with no text pattern, which
//! copies when the tagged Ctrl+C reaches it — the clipboard put back
//! after, with the changes of the window kept from every history: Pane's
//! own clipboard watch of the test's, running beside the read, reports
//! nothing while it happens. A target that is not responding fails,
//! saying so, and nothing is sent to it. The reads run in this process
//! (the test binary cannot serve as Pane's worker), on the same code the
//! worker runs, asked the same way with the same timeout.
//!
//! This needs a session with real input, so the test runs only where
//! `PANE_TEST_REAL_INPUT=1` is set (CI's Windows runner sets it); without
//! it the test passes without looking. It touches nothing but the
//! windows, the processes and the clipboard writes it owns, and it
//! brings nothing to the front that it did not create.
