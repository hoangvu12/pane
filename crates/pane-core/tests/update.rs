//! Automatic updates of installed npm, Git and default-extension
//! packages through the launcher's public interface: the npm ones from a
//! local registry on 127.0.0.1 that each test fills
//! (`support/npm_registry.rs`), the Git ones from a repository each test
//! makes with the `git` program and serves over Git's smart HTTP protocol
//! from 127.0.0.1 (`support/repo_server.rs`), and the default extensions
//! from repositories of their own, made and served the same way and
//! pinned as a Pane release pins them (`support/defaults.rs`, the
//! fixture `installer.rs` uses for first setup) — nothing here reaches
//! the network, the real npm registry or a real Git host. The npm package
//! is the assembled JavaScript settings sample
//! (`target/guests/packages/sample-settings-js`) packed as an npm
//! package: its Greeting command saves settings and has "Save after
//! waiting", which waits ten seconds, so that a command still running can
//! stand in the update's way. The Git package is the assembled Git sample
//! (`target/guests/git/greeter`), whose tracked `release` branch moves to
//! a newer commit. The default extensions are the settings sample's
//! package in repositories of their own, whose release tags move.
//!
//! What is checked: a newer version updates the npm package by itself
//! once no command of it runs, keeping its identity, its settings and its
//! disabled state, ending the old code's generation, and a tracked
//! branch that has moved updates the Git package the same way, keeping
//! its identity and its tracked reference, while a pinned revision never
//! moves; a newer release tag updates a default extension the same way,
//! keeping the default identity, its settings and its controls, while
//! one disabled, turned off or uninstalled is never updated by itself
//! (and an older Pane's record, which keeps no repository, is skipped);
//! a command that is running finishes first, the update waiting until
//! the screen the user is on closes; a pinned, disabled, or turned-off
//! package is never replaced, and neither is an installed local folder's
//! copy; the global and per-extension controls work through Manage
//! extensions, a Git package's and a default's row among them; an
//! incompatible version, a dependency that cannot be installed, an
//! unreachable registry and a tracked branch that has moved to a
//! source-only revision explain and leave the installed copy alone, as
//! an unreachable default's repository does; an action or an opening
//! asked in the moment the replacement is being applied is refused rather
//! than started and stopped by it; a new version that fails to start is
//! not rolled back; and the check repeats on its cadence, and at Pane's
//! start.
