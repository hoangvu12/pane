//! The local channel (#217) as `pane-ext dev` uses it, against a launcher
//! listening on an endpoint of the test's own, as the running Pane does. A
//! folder Pane has not installed is shown for installation with the build
//! handed over, and developed once the author installs it; declining the
//! preview refuses the build; an installed folder is developed at once.
//! Pane's messages and what the package prints come back as log events; a
//! build that failed elsewhere keeps the working code and is shown as Pane's
//! own are; a later build is reloaded; closing the connection stops the
//! development, and stopping it in Pane ends the connection's. The builds
//! are the guests `cargo xtask guests` builds, staged as `pane-ext` stages
//! its builds.
