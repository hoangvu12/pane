//! The extension runtime's epoch ticker and watchdog wait while no guest
//! call runs (#190), through the launcher's public interface, with the
//! settings sample from `cargo xtask guests`. With nothing in flight both
//! wait, and neither ticks nor looks; a call starting wakes both, they tick
//! and look while it runs, and they wait again once it was answered. What
//! they do while a call runs (stopping a computing guest after its limit,
//! giving up on a stuck thread, timing schedules and services) is checked,
//! unchanged, by the `unresponsive`, `pausing`, `stopping`, `runtime_crash`,
//! `schedules` and `services` tests; the race between a call starting and
//! the ticker going to wait by `deadlines`' own tests.
//!
//! The hook that reports the timers exists in debug builds only.
