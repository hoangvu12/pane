//! The state handoff through the launcher's public interface (#159,
//! ADR 0041): a package whose component opts in by exporting the lifecycle
//! interface keeps what it had in memory when its code is replaced — on
//! Reload, an Update the user chose and a development-mode reload, only
//! once the replacement passed its checks, never after a crash, a pause, a
//! failure to start, Retry, a disable followed by an enable, or a restart
//! of Pane — and the command screen that was on display opens again on the
//! new code with its original launch record, for every package whether or
//! not it opted in: only the command's root view, not the views or forms
//! it had pushed.
//!
//! The handoff sample in Rust, JavaScript and TypeScript (real guests
//! `cargo xtask guests` assembles) keeps a counter and a draft in memory;
//! the handoff fixture (also Rust) drives the edges: an instance busy with
//! a call, a snapshot that misses the 1-second deadline or exceeds the
//! 1-megabyte limit, and a restore that errs or traps. Development mode's
//! diagnostics report each; elsewhere a dropped snapshot is silent.
