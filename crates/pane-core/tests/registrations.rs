//! Owned registrations through the launcher's public interface (#158,
//! ADR 0041): a dynamic root item, a timer, a folder watcher and a
//! run-time provision, each an owned registration the guest holds as a
//! resource, with the registrations sample in Rust, JavaScript and
//! TypeScript (real guests `cargo xtask guests` assembles) and the
//! registrations fixture (also Rust) for the edges. What is registered is
//! undone when the handle is dropped, when the instance holding it goes
//! and when the generation ends — a disable, a pause, a reload, an update
//! or an uninstall — leaving the generation's undo list empty (#136's
//! test hook); nothing an extension registered outlives its code, and the
//! activation entry point makes the registrations again without waiting
//! for the user. The consumers of a run-time capability see the provider
//! only while it holds its provision: they wait for it and come back, or
//! fall back to another provider. Timers fire by the launcher's clock,
//! coalescing while the package waits; a watcher's changes coalesce.
