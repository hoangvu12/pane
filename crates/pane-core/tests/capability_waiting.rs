//! Commands that wait while no provider can serve a required capability
//! (#156, the second slice of #151's waiting commands): while a required
//! capability of an enabled, unpaused package has no provider that is
//! installed, enabled, not paused and not waiting, the package's commands
//! stay listed saying what they need, nothing of them runs — not their
//! views, their scheduled work, their services or their results — and they
//! come back by themselves once a provider can serve again. A use narrowed
//! with `commands` gates only those commands; a use of every provider
//! (`"use": "all"`) never gates, degrading to an empty list; an optional
//! use never gates. A chain through capabilities names what is actually
//! missing, a cycle with one member unable waits as a whole, and a
//! provider that is also a consumer never serves itself. Enter on a
//! waiting command offers to install the default its use names, or an
//! extension that provides the capability, from the install forms.
//!
//! A fan-out (`call-every`) calls every provider that can serve now, in
//! the order Pane calls them, each answering with its title and result or
//! error; the providers that cannot serve are skipped, with none the list
//! is empty, and a fan-out of a use of one provider is refused.
//!
//! Through the launcher's public interface, with the capability samples in
//! all three languages (their greet use made one provider again, as it was
//! before the fan-out item's `"use": "all"`), the capabilities fixture,
//! and the manual clock.
