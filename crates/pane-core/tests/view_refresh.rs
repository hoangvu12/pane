//! A designed view that changes by itself (#236): its render's answer
//! asks Pane to draw it again after some milliseconds
//! (`refresh-after-ms`), so a timer or a poll runs with no change to the
//! extension runtime. These checks drive the launcher with its clock
//! under the test's hand (`ManualClock`, as the schedules' and services'
//! tests do): a view refreshes at the time it asked for, its ask clamped
//! to the 100 ms floor and the 24 h ceiling (driven through the
//! hand-written `designed` fixture, whose answers no SDK writes, so the
//! clamp is Pane's reading alone), refreshes pause while the launcher's
//! window is hidden, one that fell due then catching up once — from the
//! clock's current time, not the ticks it missed — and leaving the view
//! cancelling its refresh. The timer samples in Rust, JavaScript and
//! TypeScript load their data as a loading state first and then advance
//! by themselves, held to the tri-lingual parity the other samples are.
//!
//! Components come from `cargo xtask guests`; the JavaScript and
//! TypeScript ones are the prebuilt components in `guests/prebuilt/`.
