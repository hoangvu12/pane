# Resource and latency measurement of Pane's whole process tree on X11 (#4).
# One fixed workload, documented in docs/research/resource-measurements.md:
# a cold start (a fresh data folder, nothing installed), warm restarts, an
# idle core, Pane hidden with its default extensions (#189), seven
# installed-but-unused extensions, the calculator run repeatedly, the
# Watching continuing service and the Counting scheduled work running, and
# repeated reload and disable of one package. Pane's whole process tree —
# Pane and any helper it started, and every thread of it — is sampled from
# /proc at a fixed cadence (scripts/proc_tree.py watch) while the workload
# runs, and the record is written beside the workload's screenshots:
# samples.jsonl (one JSON line per sample), events.jsonl, summary.json and
# record.json in the output folder. The summary is checked against
# scripts/resource-targets.json (the proposed targets; a null ceiling is
# pending, not checked).
#
# Requires what scripts/smoke-linux.sh requires: Xvfb, xdotool, Pillow (the
# one screenshot check), a Vulkan driver, and for Settings, where the
# lifecycle's reloads and disables happen (#168), dbus-launch (dbus-x11),
# at-spi2-core, python3-gi and gir1.2-atspi-2.0; plus the guests built
# (`cargo xtask ci` or `cargo xtask guests`) and the default extensions'
# payloads in target/dist/artifacts (`cargo xtask package-linux --dev`,
# which CI's smoke run, before this one, leaves there). The binary measured
# is the one given (target/debug/pane by default, the smoke's; record.json
# records the profile: a release build reaches for the not-yet-deployed
# artifact source at start, so the release profile's workload waits for
# that source).
# Set PANE_XVFB / PANE_XDOTOOL to use binaries outside PATH.
#
# The workload's fixed durations can be shortened for a quick run; the
# documented record is the defaults: PANE_MEASURE_IDLE_SECONDS (60),
# PANE_MEASURE_HIDDEN_SECONDS (60), PANE_MEASURE_SETTLE_SECONDS (30),
# PANE_MEASURE_UNUSED_SECONDS (60), PANE_MEASURE_SERVICE_SECONDS (90),
# PANE_MEASURE_CALCULATOR_RUNS (10), PANE_MEASURE_WARM_RESTARTS (3),
# PANE_MEASURE_RELOADS (6), PANE_MEASURE_DISABLES (5),
# PANE_MEASURE_SAMPLE_SECONDS (1).
# Usage: scripts/measure-linux.sh <output-dir> [pane-binary]

# 8. Repeated lifecycle: one package of its own in a fresh data folder,
# managed on its page in Settings (#168), which stays open through both
# phases. Each reload (Reload, an item of the page's Actions menu) swaps
# the component between the Rust and the JavaScript sample and waits until
# Pane replaced the managed copy; each disable cycle disables and enables
# the package again with the page's switch.
