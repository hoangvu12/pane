# capture-pane-windows.ps1 - isolated native launcher visual checks.
#
# Launches an interactive Pane build, waits for its real window, focuses it,
# captures real desktop pixels (window crop by default), optionally sends a
# key sequence through native SendKeys (focus re-checked before EVERY key),
# and closes ONLY the process it started (unless -LeaveOpen). The script
# never deletes anything, never touches the user's data folder or existing
# windows, and gives Pane a per-run scratch data directory and a per-run
# scratch LOCALAPPDATA (Pane's cache is %LOCALAPPDATA%\Pane\cache on
# Windows - crates/pane/src/lib.rs cache_dir(); PANE_CACHE_DIR is NOT read)
# through spawn-scoped environment variables that are restored immediately
# after the child starts. PANE_ARTIFACTS is cleared for the child only, so
# no default-extension downloads or update checks run.
#
# Focus handling: SetWindowPos-untouched activation via SetForegroundWindow
# with an EXPLICIT Int64 HWND comparison, then a WScript.Shell.AppActivate
# fallback that names ONLY the spawned process Id. Neither method's return
# value is treated as focus: confirmation is always the actual foreground
# HWND (GetForegroundWindow), checked again before every key token. When
# focus cannot be confirmed, keys are never sent and the run exits 1, with
# the foreground diagnosis (HWND, owning PID, whether it is Pane's process)
# recorded in pane-run.json.
#
# Last-resort opt-in -ClickToFocus (default OFF): one REAL guarded click
# inside Pane's own window - WindowFromPoint must prove the point belongs
# to the spawned window tree before the cursor moves and again immediately
# before the click (no click when a foreign window covers it), the cursor
# is saved and restored only if nothing moved it, and 'guarded-click' is
# recorded as the activation method only when the real foreground check
# then confirms Pane's exact HWND. Normal native UI testing with the real
# pointer: opt in only for testing your own window.
#
# Adapted from the retained prototype's .scratch/native-review helper.
