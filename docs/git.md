# Extension packages from Git repositories

Added for [#46](https://github.com/pane-app/pane/issues/46) (US16–US18,
US20–US24, T11, T12, G4, G6; contributions), following
[ADR 0012](adr/0012-pi-style-source-identity.md)'s Git identity and the
proposed [ADR 0021](adr/0021-pane-fetches-git-packages-itself.md). A Pane
extension can be distributed as a public Git repository whose root holds its
`pane.json`. Pane fetches the one revision the user names and installs it
itself: the user needs no Git, compiler or other tool, and nothing in the
repository runs to install it.

## Layout: release and source-only revisions

A repository is a package when its root holds `pane.json`. A revision (a
commit) can be installed when its tree also holds the built components
`pane.json` names, and this system's helper files: a **release revision**,
such as a release tag or a release branch the author commits the build to.
A revision holding only the source is **source-only**: Pane explains it and
installs nothing, since it never builds anything ("The default branch, main
(commit 2cefb4e216e6) of the Git repository github.com/owner/repo holds only
the source of "Greeter from Git": its built component dist/git_greeter.wasm
is not in it. Pane does not build packages from Git or run anything in a
repository; install a release revision whose commit includes the built
components (its author's release tag or branch), or build it yourself and
install the folder"). Not every tag of a repository is installable, and
Pane does not look for one that is.

The author example is [`guests/git/greeter`](../guests/git/greeter), a Rust
package's source whose README gives the steps from source to release
revision ([Publishing a package from a Git repository](../guests/README.md#publishing-a-package-from-a-git-repository)).
The controlled repository the tests and smokes make from it has the source
alone on `main` and the build on the branch `release`, tagged `v0.1.0`.

## Installing one

- **Install extension from Git…**, root search's row after "Install
  extension from npm…", opens a form of Pane's own with one field, the
  repository: its address and optionally `@` and a branch, tag or commit.
  **Show package** fetches it and shows the preview; Back returns to root
  search, discarding a fetch in progress.
- `pane --install git:<address>[@<reference>]` opens the same preview.

An address is any of `https://github.com/owner/repo`,
`https://github.com/owner/repo.git`, `github.com/owner/repo`,
`git@github.com:owner/repo.git` and `ssh://git@github.com/owner/repo`, with
or without `git:` or `git+` before it. Pane fetches each over HTTPS from the
same host and path (it has no SSH), as written, `.git` and case included;
the preview says when an SSH address was fetched over HTTPS.

The preview is the one a folder has, with lines of its own:

- "Source: Git repository github.com/owner/repo": the identity.
- The revision and whether it is tracked or pinned: "Revision: the default
  branch, main, tracked: an update fetches that branch again", "Revision:
  branch release, tracked: …", "Revision: tag v1.0.0, which you named:
  installing pins it to that revision", "Revision: commit 1a2b3c4d5e6f,
  which you named: …", or, for an installed pinned copy, "…, which it is
  pinned to: name another branch, tag or commit to change it".
- "Fetched: commit <full id> “<commit subject>”, served at <address>; each
  object checked against its id", or, for an SSH address, "…, SSH address
  fetched over HTTPS from https://…; …". It says where the commit was
  served, not who made it ([provenance](#a-commit-id-pins-contents-not-provenance)).
  The subject, like any text the server chooses, is shown without control
  characters or format characters (bidirectional, zero-width, tags) and cut
  to 200 characters.
- For a commit named by its id that no branch or tag of the repository
  points to: "Caution: no branch or tag of github.com/owner/repo points to
  commit 1a2b3c4d5e6f. A host that shares storage between forks, as GitHub
  does, can serve a fork's or a pull request's commit at this address, so
  its id alone does not show that this repository made it".
- "Pane builds nothing and runs no repository hooks, scripts or
  submodules" (what the package does run, its components and any native
  helpers it ships, is listed as the preview's "Commands:", "Operations:"
  and "Helpers:").

Install copies `pane.json`, the components it names and this system's
helper files into Pane, as for a folder, and records the package in
`installed.json` as `"git": "<host>/<path>", "gitUrl": "<address fetched>",
"gitRef": "refs/tags/v1.0.0", "gitCommit": "<id>", "pinned": true` (no
`gitRef` for the default branch or a commit named by its id; `pinned` for a
tag or a commit; for one extension of a [collection](#one-extension-of-a-collection-307),
`"gitExtension": "<id>"` beside them). Its commands then run like any other.

The revision is written into a download folder of its own under the data
folder's `extensions/downloads/`, the one npm downloads use, removed once the
preview is shown, once an install ends and on every failure.

## Identity

The identity is the repository without its reference: `git:` and the host
in lowercase (with its port, unless it is HTTPS's 443) and the path without
a trailing `/` or `.git` (`git:github.com/owner/repo`). On github.com,
gitlab.com, bitbucket.org and codeberg.org, which serve a repository at any
case of its path, the path is lowercased as well and `.git` dropped in any
case, so `github.com/Owner/Repo` and `github.com/owner/repo` are one package
(the user's decision); on any other host, or one of those on another port,
the path keeps its case, since a server may tell the two apart. Every
address form above names the same package, so a second install is refused
("Already installed from Git repository github.com/owner/repo; use Update to
replace the installed copy") and choosing it again, with any reference,
offers **Update**. A copy of the same code from a folder or from npm is
another package, installed beside it and never changed by it: Pane does not
merge sources, move data between them or infer personal and project scopes.
Moving a repository to another host or path makes another package.

## One extension of a collection (#307)

A repository whose root holds `pane-collection.json` rather than `pane.json`
is a **collection** ([ADR 0044](adr/0044-a-git-repository-holds-one-extension-or-a-collection.md)):
it lists the extensions it offers, each by an id (lowercase letters, digits
and `-`) and the folder holding it, with an optional `renamed` map of ids it
renamed or removed. `#<id>` after the repository names one of them, a
reference following as a reference follows a repository
(`git:github.com/owner/tools#clock@refs/tags/clock/v1.2.0`), and it
installs as a package of its own: the identity is
`git:github.com/owner/tools#clock`, and it gets its own preview (which
names the extension), managed copy, record, disabled state, uninstall and
data, as any installed package. A second install of the same identity is
refused; another extension of the same collection, or the repository's own
package were it one, installs beside it.

Only the files under the extension's folder reach its managed copy, so it
must be self-contained: a component outside the folder is missing, and the
revision is explained as source-only. An index that cannot be taken is
refused saying what is wrong: a root holding both manifests, an unknown
field, a duplicate id or path, a malformed id, an id reused through
`renamed`, a path that is not a plain relative folder, or a path naming no
package.

Each extension is released on its own, its releases tagged `<id>/v<semver>`
(Go's convention for modules in subfolders), so a fix to one never forces
a version on the rest; the repository's own tags — other extensions' and
`v<semver>` — are never taken for one's. An extension installed from its
own release tag [updates by itself](#updating-by-itself) to the newest
release above the version installed, pinned to that tag's commit; one on
a tracked reference updates as any Git package does, the newer revision
read through the collection's index, so an extension whose folder moved
within it still updates, keeping its identity. A revision whose index no
longer lists the id is refused — following a rename, or reporting a
removal, is a later ticket — and the extension keeps running its
installed code.

Naming a collection without an id, by address or by a picked folder, is
explained as a collection whose extension must be named; the list to choose
from comes with a later ticket. A `#<id>` on a one-extension repository is
refused. A local folder takes `#<id>` the same way
(`pane --install <folder>#<id>`; the part after the last `#` is the id),
with the identity `local:<folder>#<id>`, and a dependency's `git:` or
`local:` source may name one extension of a collection, following the
conflict rules a dependency's source already follows.

## References, tracking and pins

| Named | Installs | An update without a reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| nothing | the default branch's commit (its `HEAD`) | fetches the default branch again (tracked) |
| `@main`, `@refs/heads/main` | that branch's commit | fetches that branch again (tracked) |
| `@v1.0.0`, `@refs/tags/v1.0.0` | the commit the tag points to | installs that tag again (pinned) |
| `@<40 hexadecimal digits>` | that commit | installs that commit again (pinned) |

### A commit id pins contents, not provenance

A commit id pins the bytes: the files are exactly that commit's tree. It
does not show that the repository at the address made the commit. GitHub
(and other hosts that share object storage between a repository and its
forks) serves a commit that exists only in a fork, or in a pull request
never merged, at the upstream repository's address too, so
`trusted/repo@<id>` can install code the owners of `trusted/repo` never
accepted. Pane cannot tell from the server where a commit came from, so
when a commit is named by its id it also lists the repository's `HEAD`,
branches and tags (peeled) and cautions on the preview when none of them
points to that commit: for the package previewed, and for each Git
dependency installed with a package ("Caution (Greeter from Git): no branch
or tag of … points to commit …", below its "Requires:" line). A branch or a tag is resolved from the repository's
own listing, so a fork's commit is never installed through one; prefer a
tag the repository's owners published when choosing what to pin.

Naming another reference changes the recorded one. A name that is both a
branch and a tag is refused until written `refs/heads/…` or `refs/tags/…`;
an abbreviated commit id is not accepted. An update keeps the identity,
its data, whether it is disabled, its hotkeys and aliases, as a folder's
does; a tracked branch also updates [by itself](#updating-by-itself).
A Git package has no **Reload** or **Develop** row: it has no source
folder on this computer.

## Updating by itself

An eligible Git package updates by itself, as [an npm package
does](npm.md#updating-by-itself) (#50): the same updater thread, on the
same cadence (a minute after Pane starts, then every 24 hours, by the
launcher's clock) and under the same controls (the global row in the
extension list and a per-package one, in `updates.json`), applying at the
same safe activation boundary — never during a command of the package
the user asked for that has not answered, nor while one of its screens is
on display, retrying every second until the package is quiet, listed in
the update results as "Waiting until <title> is not in use" until it
applies — and applying as the preview's Update row does: the identity,
saved data, disabled state, hotkeys and aliases are kept, the old
generation ends, managed background work restarts with the new code, and
the outcome is the pass's update results, a quiet row with the old and
the new commit ("1a2b3c4d5e6f → 6f5e4d3c2b1a"). The user can also ask
for a check at once — root search's **Check for Extension Updates**
command, or the Settings Extensions page's **Check for updates** button —
which looks at every tracked package, turned off, disabled and paused
ones included, and whose toast follows the pass (see
[npm](npm.md#updating-by-itself)).

What differs is what a check reads and what it fetches. A check of a
tracked package asks the repository for its reference listing alone —
the same `ls-refs` a preview's fetch begins with, without fetching a
commit — and nothing is fetched while the tracked branch points at the
commit installed. When it has moved, the new commit is fetched (with
`deepen 1`, as an install fetches it) and checked exactly as an install
checks a package; a check or an update that fails — the repository gone,
the branch deleted, the moved-to revision source-only, its manifest or
API or components or helpers no longer passing — is a Failed row in the
update results ("It was not updated: Branch release (commit …) of the
Git repository … holds only the source of …; It keeps running its
installed code"), announced once the next time the launcher is shown,
and leaves the installed copy as it is.

One extension of a collection installed from its own release tag
`<id>/v<semver>` (ADR 0044) is checked differently: the repository's tags
with the extension's prefix (`ls-refs` with `refs/tags/<id>/`) alone say
what its newest release is — nothing is fetched while the newest names
the version installed, and the repository's other tags, other
extensions' and `v<semver>`, are never taken for its. When a newer
release exists, the tag's commit is fetched and checked as an install
checks a package, read through the collection's index so an extension
whose folder moved within it still updates, and the extension is pinned
to that tag's commit — the update is its own, never moving another
extension of the collection. A revision whose index no longer lists the
id is a Failed row ("It was not updated: Tag clock/v0.2.0 (commit …) of
the Git repository … lists no extension `clock` in its
pane-collection.json; It keeps running its installed code") and the
extension keeps running its installed code; following a rename, or
reporting a removal, is a later ticket. Check for Update on its page
previews that one extension by its repository and id, at its newest
release above the version installed — the ordinary preview, whose
Update keeps or changes the recorded reference as a Git package's does.

**Which packages update** (as [npm's](npm.md#which-packages-update)):
an installed Git package that is tracked — installed from the default
branch or a named branch — or, one extension of a collection, installed
from its own release tag; enabled, not paused after a failure, and not
turned off; any other tag or a commit named to install it pins it, and
an update installs that revision again, so it is never updated by
itself. The same
safe boundary defers an update while a command runs, and an update the
user chose (choosing the repository again, Update on its preview, `pane
--install git:<address>`) replaces the copy without waiting, as a reload
does.

**Provisional, pending the user's decision:** the shared cadence and
retry timing (see [npm](npm.md#updating-by-itself)), and that a
tracked branch is followed even when its new commit holds an older
version, as `latest` is.

## Dependencies from Git

A `pane.json` dependency's `source` may be `git:<address>` or
`git:<address>@<reference>` ([dependencies](dependencies.md#declaring)), in a
local, npm or Git package. The plan, claims and rollback are #42's:

- A missing required one is fetched while the preview is worked out, listed
  as "Requires: Greeter from Git, installed with it from
  git:https://github.com/owner/repo@v1.0.0", and installed first, at the
  reference named (tracked or pinned as above). A commit named by its id
  that no branch or tag points to is cautioned about on the next line, as
  for a package ([provenance](#a-commit-id-pins-contents-not-provenance)).
- An installed one is used as it is, and never fetched again, unless the
  source names a reference the installed copy is not at: "Nothing was
  installed: Caller requires Greeter from Git at v1.0.0, and branch release
  (commit …) is installed; Pane does not replace the installed copy while
  installing another extension: update it to v1.0.0 (Git repository
  github.com/owner/repo@v1.0.0) if Caller needs that revision". Two
  dependents naming different references conflict likewise.
- Its record is `{ "id": "greeter", "git": "<host>/<path>" }`; a call by the
  dependency id reaches it, and a call by identity takes `git:` and any
  address form of the repository, without a reference.
- A package from npm or Git cannot name a `local:` folder: "… comes from Git
  but names the local folder `local:../helper` as its dependency `helper`; a
  package published to npm or Git can depend only on packages from npm or
  Git".

## What is refused

Each is explained on the preview, which then offers nothing, and nothing is
installed or left in the downloads folder:

| Case | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Not an address Pane fetches | "`ftp://…` is not a Git repository address: Pane fetches Git repositories over HTTPS, and does not use `ftp://`"; plain `http://` ("… only over HTTPS …"), credentials in the address, `?`, `%`, `..` (a `#` after the repository path names one extension of a [collection](#one-extension-of-a-collection-307), so it is taken as the id rather than refused) |
| No repository there | "There is no Git repository at https://…" |
| A private repository | "The Git repository … asks to sign in (its server answered 401): Pane sends no credentials, so it installs only from public repositories" |
| A redirect | "…/info/refs?service=git-upload-pack answered 301, sending Pane elsewhere: Pane follows no redirect, so name the repository by the address it moved to" |
| An older server | "The Git repository … is not served with Git's protocol version 2 over HTTPS, which Pane needs …"; SHA-256 repositories are refused too |
| No such reference | "The Git repository … has no branch or tag named nope"; "… has both a branch and a tag named x; name the one to install as …@refs/heads/x or …@refs/tags/x"; a commit it does not have: "Could not fetch commit … of …: …" |
| Too large | a reference listing over 16 MiB (for a branch or tag; for a commit named by its id, such a listing is taken as naming no branch or tag that points to it, so the preview cautions rather than refuses), a pack over 64 MiB, more than 20,000 objects, more than 256 MiB of its contents in memory at once (entries inflated and objects its deltas make, together), a chain of more than 4096 deltas, files over 256 MiB, more than 10,000 files and folders, folders more than 32 deep |
| A damaged or forged pack | its checksum, a zlib stream, a delta, an object whose id does not match (so the tree is not the commit's), or data crafted to collide under SHA-1 |
| An unsafe tree | "… cannot be installed safely: its tree contains `dist/link`, a symbolic link; Pane takes only files and folders every system can write"; also a submodule, a `.git` or `git~1` entry (in any case, and with the zero-width and direction characters HFS+ ignores in a name, as Git checks), two names differing only in case, an entry that is not one plain name (`a/b`, `../x`, an absolute `/path`, `\`, `.`, `..`: refused before anything is written outside the download folder), a name longer than 255 bytes (refused before the rest of it is read, and shown from its start only), and every name npm's unpacking refuses ([npm](npm.md#what-is-refused)) |
| Not a Pane extension | "… is not a Pane extension: it has no pane.json at the repository's root …" |
| Source-only | [above](#layout-release-and-source-only-revisions) |
| Git LFS | "… stores its component dist/x.wasm with Git LFS, which Pane does not fetch: …" |

Then every check a folder gets applies: its manifest, WASI 0.3 imports, the
extension API shape, its platforms and its helpers for this system.

## What never runs

Pane has no `git` program, library or configuration of its own: the
repository's hooks, `.gitattributes` filters and line-ending conversions,
`core.fsmonitor`, `core.sshCommand`, `uploadpack` and `protocol.allow`
settings and `GIT_*` variables cannot apply, and files are written exactly
as committed. Submodules and Git LFS objects are never fetched; build
scripts (`build.rs`, `package.json` scripts, Makefiles) are never run.

## The client

The requests go through Pane's one HTTP client (hyper, rustls and the
system's certificates, [ADR 0018](adr/0018-extensions-reach-the-network-through-wasi-http.md),
[ADR 0019](adr/0019-pane-downloads-npm-packages-itself.md)): a new
connection per request, no proxy, no redirect, no credentials, a
User-Agent of `git/pane-<version>`, at most 30 s to connect, 60 s between
pieces and 5 minutes per request. The fetch asks for the one commit without
history (`deepen 1`) when the server offers it. Only a development build or
a test fetches plain `http://`, and only from a loopback address written as
one; the tests and smokes serve their repositories that way
([`repo_server.rs`](../crates/pane-core/tests/support/repo_server.rs),
[`scripts/repository_server.py`](../scripts/repository_server.py)), so none
of them reaches the network. Those servers, not Pane, run `git upload-pack`,
with none of the user's Git configuration.

### Trying a real host by hand

No check reaches a real Git host; a contributor can try one by hand, with a
public repository holding a Pane package's release revision:

1. `cargo build --release -p pane`.
2. `PANE_DATA_DIR=<a new folder> target/release/pane --install
   git:https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>@<tag>`. The preview's "Fetched:"
   line names the commit; compare it with `git ls-remote <address> <tag>`
   (its peeled `^{}` line for an annotated tag).
3. Choose **Install**, run its command, and check that
   `<folder>/extensions/installed.json` records `gitRef` and `gitCommit`,
   and that `<folder>/extensions/downloads/` is empty.
4. To see a refusal, name the repository's development branch if it holds
   only the source, or any repository without `pane.json`.

**Not run**: no one has tried this against GitHub, GitLab or another host
yet.

## Checks

- Unit tests in [`git.rs`](../crates/pane-core/src/git.rs): address forms
  and their identity, references, HTTPS only (plain HTTP from a loopback
  address in tests), case folded on github.com, gitlab.com, bitbucket.org
  and codeberg.org only, SSH addresses noted, pkt-lines, packs (checksum,
  deltas by offset and by id, a missing base, object counts, 2,000 deltas
  against ids written base last, a chain of 4096 deltas and one longer, the
  shared memory budget with deltas' instructions let go), trees (links,
  submodules, `.git`, unsafe names, names differing in case, limits of
  entries, size and depth), files without execute permission, Git LFS
  pointers, and a server's text (subject, `ERR`, a connection failure)
  shown without control or format characters and cut. `downloads.rs` checks that a name is
  one plain name (`a/b`, `../x`, `/abs`, `sub/.git`, `..`, `.`, `\`).
- [`crates/pane-core/tests/repositories.rs`](../crates/pane-core/tests/repositories.rs),
  against Git's own server (`git upload-pack`) on 127.0.0.1: preview,
  install and run from a tag, after a restart without fetching again; the
  source-only default branch; a tracked branch moving and updated, a commit
  and a tag pinned; the identity across address forms, a local copy of the
  same code beside it; a local package requiring a Git one at a tag; a
  dependency naming another revision; a Git package naming a local folder;
  a link and a submodule; hand-made hostile trees (`../x`, `../../x`, an
  absolute path, a folder `../x`, `dist/x`, `..\x`, `sub/.git`) writing
  nothing outside the download and leaving no download behind; a commit
  only a pull request's reference holds, previewed with the caution, and
  commits, branches and tags a reference points to without it; another
  case of the path on a host treated as github.com is the installed
  package, and a dependency spelled so resolves to it without fetching;
  hooks, filters and install scripts never running
  and components taken as committed; missing repositories, references and
  commits, ambiguous names, redirects, sign-in, protocol version 0, a
  `# service` line, an unreachable server; the form; since #307, one
  extension of a collection installed by its id (with the id recorded beside
  the Git fields, only its folder's files in the managed copy, a duplicate
  install refused and choosing it again offering Update), every way an
  index is refused, a component outside the extension's folder explained as
  source-only, the local-folder form, and a dependency's `git:` and `local:`
  sources naming one extension of a collection.
- [`crates/pane/tests/repositories.rs`](../crates/pane/tests/repositories.rs):
  the form, the source-only explanation, preview, Install in view below whole Git lines and the
  command running in the native window at Pane's size; one extension of a
  collection previewed by its id, installed and run, with its page in
  Settings.
- [`crates/pane-core/tests/update.rs`](../crates/pane-core/tests/update.rs)
  for the [automatic updates](#updating-by-itself) of Git packages, from
  the same server: a tracked branch that has moved updating by itself
  (identity, tracked reference and pin kept, the new copy running), a
  pinned tag never asked about, the per-package control row, and a
  branch that has moved to a source-only revision refused with the
  installed copy untouched; since #309, one extension of a collection
  installed from its own release tag updating to the newest one above
  the version installed, choosing it among other extensions' tags, a
  prerelease and the repository's root `v<semver>` tag; a tracked branch
  moving the extension's folder within the collection, its identity
  kept; each extension updating on its own, one's release never moving
  another; a release whose index no longer lists the id refused; one
  that needs a newer Pane refused; a pinned tag that is not the
  extension's own never asked about; and Check for Update on its page
  previewing it at its newest release (or its installed one, when
  none is newer).
- The native smokes' own phase (frames 300 to 307;
  [Linux](platforms/linux.md#git-packages-46)).

## Limits

- Public repositories over HTTPS only: no SSH, credentials, proxies or
  private hosts' sign-in; SHA-256 repositories are refused.
- The package must be at the repository's root; submodules and Git LFS are
  not fetched.
- No check for a newer commit other than the updater's [tracked-branch
  and release-tag checks](#updating-by-itself) and choosing the repository
  again, no history browser and no publishing to a host.
- Signed tags and commits are not checked; the commit id, checked object by
  object, is the pin, and it proves contents, not provenance: a fork's
  commit served at the repository's address is only cautioned about, on
  the preview of the package named by that commit or of the package that
  requires it; an installed dependency is not fetched again, so it is not
  checked again.
- Tags and branches are resolved on the server; a server that does not
  allow fetching an unadvertised commit id refuses a commit named by its id
  (GitHub, GitLab and Git's own server allow it).
- The pack and its objects are held in memory while the revision is written
  (at most 64 MiB and 256 MiB).
- Only github.com, gitlab.com, bitbucket.org and codeberg.org fold the
  path's case; another host that ignores case (a self-hosted GitLab, say)
  makes `Owner/Repo` and `owner/repo` two packages.
- The HTTPS path to a real host is not exercised by the checks, which never
  reach the network ([by hand](#trying-a-real-host-by-hand)).
