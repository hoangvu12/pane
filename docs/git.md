# Extension packages from Git repositories

Added for [#46](https://github.com/hoangvu12/pane/issues/46) (US16–US18,
US20–US24, T11, T12, G4, G6; contributions), following
[ADR 0012](adr/0012-pi-style-source-identity.md)'s Git identity and the
proposed [ADR 0021](adr/0021-pane-fetches-git-packages-itself.md). A Pane
extension can be distributed as a public Git repository whose root holds its
`pane.json`. Pane fetches the one revision the user names and installs it
itself: the user needs no Git, compiler or other tool, and nothing in the
repository runs to install it.

## Layout: release and source-only revisions

A repository is a package when its root holds `pane.json`. A revision (a
commit) can be installed when its tree also holds the built components
`pane.json` names, and this system's helper files: a **release revision**,
such as a release tag or a release branch the author commits the build to.
A revision holding only the source is **source-only**: Pane explains it and
installs nothing, since it never builds anything ("The default branch, main
(commit 2cefb4e216e6) of the Git repository github.com/owner/repo holds only
the source of "Greeter from Git": its built component dist/git_greeter.wasm
is not in it. Pane does not build packages from Git or run anything in a
repository; install a release revision whose commit includes the built
components (its author's release tag or branch), or build it yourself and
install the folder"). Not every tag of a repository is installable, and
Pane does not look for one that is.

The author example is [`guests/git/greeter`](../guests/git/greeter), a Rust
package's source whose README gives the steps from source to release
revision ([Publishing a package from a Git repository](../guests/README.md#publishing-a-package-from-a-git-repository)).
The controlled repository the tests and smokes make from it has the source
alone on `main` and the build on the branch `release`, tagged `v0.1.0`.

## Installing one

- **Install extension from Git…**, root search's row after "Install
  extension from npm…", opens a form of Pane's own with one field, the
  repository: its address and optionally `@` and a branch, tag or commit.
  **Show package** fetches it and shows the preview; Back returns to root
  search, discarding a fetch in progress.
- `pane --install git:<address>[@<reference>]` opens the same preview.

An address is any of `https://github.com/owner/repo`,
`https://github.com/owner/repo.git`, `github.com/owner/repo`,
`git@github.com:owner/repo.git` and `ssh://git@github.com/owner/repo`, with
or without `git:` or `git+` before it. Pane fetches each over HTTPS from the
same host and path (it has no SSH), as written, `.git` and case included;
the preview says when an SSH address was fetched over HTTPS.

The preview is the one a folder has, with lines of its own:

- "Source: Git repository github.com/owner/repo": the identity.
- The revision and whether it is tracked or pinned: "Revision: the default
  branch, main, tracked: an update fetches that branch again", "Revision:
  branch release, tracked: …", "Revision: tag v1.0.0, which you named:
  installing pins it to that revision", "Revision: commit 1a2b3c4d5e6f,
  which you named: …", or, for an installed pinned copy, "…, which it is
  pinned to: name another branch, tag or commit to change it".
- "Fetched: commit <full id> “<commit subject>”, served at <address>; each
  object checked against its id", or, for an SSH address, "…, SSH address
  fetched over HTTPS from https://…; …". It says where the commit was
  served, not who made it ([provenance](#a-commit-id-pins-contents-not-provenance)).
  The subject, like any text the server chooses, is shown without control
  or bidirectional characters and cut to 200 characters.
- For a commit named by its id that no branch or tag of the repository
  points to: "Caution: no branch or tag of github.com/owner/repo points to
  commit 1a2b3c4d5e6f. A host that shares storage between forks, as GitHub
  does, can serve a fork's or a pull request's commit at this address, so
  its id alone does not show that this repository made it".
- "Runs only the components its pane.json names: nothing in the repository
  is built or run (no hooks, scripts or submodules)".

Install copies `pane.json`, the components it names and this system's
helper files into Pane, as for a folder, and records the package in
`installed.json` as `"git": "<host>/<path>", "gitUrl": "<address fetched>",
"gitRef": "refs/tags/v1.0.0", "gitCommit": "<id>", "pinned": true` (no
`gitRef` for the default branch or a commit named by its id; `pinned` for a
tag or a commit). Its commands then run like any other.

The revision is written into a download folder of its own under the data
folder's `extensions/downloads/`, the one npm downloads use, removed once the
preview is shown, once an install ends and on every failure.

## Identity

The identity is the repository without its reference: `git:` and the host
in lowercase (with its port, unless it is HTTPS's 443) and the path without
a trailing `/` or `.git` (`git:github.com/owner/repo`). On github.com,
gitlab.com, bitbucket.org and codeberg.org, which serve a repository at any
case of its path, the path is lowercased as well and `.git` dropped in any
case, so `github.com/Owner/Repo` and `github.com/owner/repo` are one package
(the user's decision); on any other host, or one of those on another port,
the path keeps its case, since a server may tell the two apart. Every
address form above names the same package, so a second install is refused
("Already installed from Git repository github.com/owner/repo; use Update to
replace the installed copy") and choosing it again, with any reference,
offers **Update**. A copy of the same code from a folder or from npm is
another package, installed beside it and never changed by it: Pane does not
merge sources, move data between them or infer personal and project scopes.
Moving a repository to another host or path makes another package.

## References, tracking and pins

| Named | Installs | An update without a reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| nothing | the default branch's commit (its `HEAD`) | fetches the default branch again (tracked) |
| `@main`, `@refs/heads/main` | that branch's commit | fetches that branch again (tracked) |
| `@v1.0.0`, `@refs/tags/v1.0.0` | the commit the tag points to | installs that tag again (pinned) |
| `@<40 hexadecimal digits>` | that commit | installs that commit again (pinned) |

### A commit id pins contents, not provenance

A commit id pins the bytes: the files are exactly that commit's tree. It
does not show that the repository at the address made the commit. GitHub
(and other hosts that share object storage between a repository and its
forks) serves a commit that exists only in a fork, or in a pull request
never merged, at the upstream repository's address too, so
`trusted/repo@<id>` can install code the owners of `trusted/repo` never
accepted. Pane cannot tell from the server where a commit came from, so
when a commit is named by its id it also lists the repository's `HEAD`,
branches and tags (peeled) and cautions on the preview when none of them
points to that commit. A branch or a tag is resolved from the repository's
own listing, so a fork's commit is never installed through one; prefer a
tag the repository's owners published when choosing what to pin.

Naming another reference changes the recorded one. A name that is both a
branch and a tag is refused until written `refs/heads/…` or `refs/tags/…`;
an abbreviated commit id is not accepted. Nothing updates by itself yet
([#50](https://github.com/hoangvu12/pane/issues/50) adds updates of tracked
branches); an update keeps the identity, its data, whether it is disabled,
its hotkeys and aliases, as a folder's does. A Git package has no **Reload**
or **Develop** row: it has no source folder on this computer.

## Dependencies from Git

A `pane.json` dependency's `source` may be `git:<address>` or
`git:<address>@<reference>` ([dependencies](dependencies.md#declaring)), in a
local, npm or Git package. The plan, claims and rollback are #42's:

- A missing required one is fetched while the preview is worked out, listed
  as "Requires: Greeter from Git, installed with it from
  git:https://github.com/owner/repo@v1.0.0", and installed first, at the
  reference named (tracked or pinned as above).
- An installed one is used as it is, and never fetched again, unless the
  source names a reference the installed copy is not at: "Nothing was
  installed: Caller requires Greeter from Git at v1.0.0, and branch release
  (commit …) is installed; Pane does not replace the installed copy while
  installing another extension: update it to v1.0.0 (Git repository
  github.com/owner/repo@v1.0.0) if Caller needs that revision". Two
  dependents naming different references conflict likewise.
- Its record is `{ "id": "greeter", "git": "<host>/<path>" }`; a call by the
  dependency id reaches it, and a call by identity takes `git:` and any
  address form of the repository, without a reference.
- A package from npm or Git cannot name a `local:` folder: "… comes from Git
  but names the local folder `local:../helper` as its dependency `helper`; a
  package published to npm or Git can depend only on packages from npm or
  Git".

## What is refused

Each is explained on the preview, which then offers nothing, and nothing is
installed or left in the downloads folder:

| Case | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Not an address Pane fetches | "`ftp://…` is not a Git repository address: Pane fetches Git repositories over HTTPS, and does not use `ftp://`"; plain `http://` ("… only over HTTPS …"), credentials in the address, `?`, `#`, `%`, `..` |
| No repository there | "There is no Git repository at https://…" |
| A private repository | "The Git repository … asks to sign in (its server answered 401): Pane sends no credentials, so it installs only from public repositories" |
| A redirect | "…/info/refs?service=git-upload-pack answered 301, sending Pane elsewhere: Pane follows no redirect, so name the repository by the address it moved to" |
| An older server | "The Git repository … is not served with Git's protocol version 2 over HTTPS, which Pane needs …"; SHA-256 repositories are refused too |
| No such reference | "The Git repository … has no branch or tag named nope"; "… has both a branch and a tag named x; name the one to install as …@refs/heads/x or …@refs/tags/x"; a commit it does not have: "Could not fetch commit … of …: …" |
| Too large | a reference listing over 16 MiB, a pack over 64 MiB, more than 20,000 objects, more than 256 MiB of its contents in memory at once (entries inflated and objects its deltas make, together), a chain of more than 4096 deltas, files over 256 MiB, more than 10,000 files and folders, folders more than 32 deep |
| A damaged or forged pack | its checksum, a zlib stream, a delta, an object whose id does not match (so the tree is not the commit's), or data crafted to collide under SHA-1 |
| An unsafe tree | "… cannot be installed safely: its tree contains `dist/link`, a symbolic link; Pane takes only files and folders every system can write"; also a submodule, a `.git` or `git~1` entry, two names differing only in case, an entry that is not one plain name (`a/b`, `../x`, an absolute `/path`, `\`, `.`, `..`: refused before anything is written outside the download folder), and every name npm's unpacking refuses ([npm](npm.md#what-is-refused)) |
| Not a Pane extension | "… is not a Pane extension: it has no pane.json at the repository's root …" |
| Source-only | [above](#layout-release-and-source-only-revisions) |
| Git LFS | "… stores its component dist/x.wasm with Git LFS, which Pane does not fetch: …" |

Then every check a folder gets applies: its manifest, WASI 0.3 imports, the
extension API shape, its platforms and its helpers for this system.

## What never runs

Pane has no `git` program, library or configuration of its own: the
repository's hooks, `.gitattributes` filters and line-ending conversions,
`core.fsmonitor`, `core.sshCommand`, `uploadpack` and `protocol.allow`
settings and `GIT_*` variables cannot apply, and files are written exactly
as committed. Submodules and Git LFS objects are never fetched; build
scripts (`build.rs`, `package.json` scripts, Makefiles) are never run.

## The client

The requests go through Pane's one HTTP client (hyper, rustls and the
system's certificates, [ADR 0018](adr/0018-extensions-reach-the-network-through-wasi-http.md),
[ADR 0019](adr/0019-pane-downloads-npm-packages-itself.md)): a new
connection per request, no proxy, no redirect, no credentials, a
User-Agent of `git/pane-<version>`, at most 30 s to connect, 60 s between
pieces and 5 minutes per request. The fetch asks for the one commit without
history (`deepen 1`) when the server offers it. Only a development build or
a test fetches plain `http://`, and only from a loopback address written as
one; the tests and smokes serve their repositories that way
([`repo_server.rs`](../crates/pane-core/tests/support/repo_server.rs),
[`scripts/repository_server.py`](../scripts/repository_server.py)), so none
of them reaches the network. Those servers, not Pane, run `git upload-pack`,
with none of the user's Git configuration.

### Trying a real host by hand

No check reaches a real Git host; a contributor can try one by hand, with a
public repository holding a Pane package's release revision:

1. `cargo build --release -p pane`.
2. `PANE_DATA_DIR=<a new folder> target/release/pane --install
   git:https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>@<tag>`. The preview's "Fetched:"
   line names the commit; compare it with `git ls-remote <address> <tag>`
   (its peeled `^{}` line for an annotated tag).
3. Choose **Install**, run its command, and check that
   `<folder>/extensions/installed.json` records `gitRef` and `gitCommit`,
   and that `<folder>/extensions/downloads/` is empty.
4. To see a refusal, name the repository's development branch if it holds
   only the source, or any repository without `pane.json`.

**Not run**: no one has tried this against GitHub, GitLab or another host
yet.

## Checks

- Unit tests in [`git.rs`](../crates/pane-core/src/git.rs): address forms
  and their identity, references, HTTPS only (plain HTTP from a loopback
  address in tests), case folded on github.com, gitlab.com, bitbucket.org
  and codeberg.org only, SSH addresses noted, pkt-lines, packs (checksum,
  deltas by offset and by id, a missing base, object counts, 2,000 deltas
  against ids written base last, a chain of 4096 deltas and one longer, the
  shared memory budget with deltas' instructions let go), trees (links,
  submodules, `.git`, unsafe names, names differing in case, limits of
  entries, size and depth), files without execute permission, Git LFS
  pointers, and a server's text (subject, `ERR`) shown without control or
  bidirectional characters and cut. `downloads.rs` checks that a name is
  one plain name (`a/b`, `../x`, `/abs`, `sub/.git`, `..`, `.`, `\`).
- [`crates/pane-core/tests/repositories.rs`](../crates/pane-core/tests/repositories.rs),
  against Git's own server (`git upload-pack`) on 127.0.0.1: preview,
  install and run from a tag, after a restart without fetching again; the
  source-only default branch; a tracked branch moving and updated, a commit
  and a tag pinned; the identity across address forms, a local copy of the
  same code beside it; a local package requiring a Git one at a tag; a
  dependency naming another revision; a Git package naming a local folder;
  a link and a submodule; hand-made hostile trees (`../x`, `../../x`, an
  absolute path, a folder `../x`, `dist/x`, `..\x`, `sub/.git`) writing
  nothing outside the download and leaving no download behind; a commit
  only a pull request's reference holds, previewed with the caution, and
  commits, branches and tags a reference points to without it; another
  case of the path on a host treated as github.com is the installed
  package, and a dependency spelled so resolves to it without fetching;
  hooks, filters and install scripts never running
  and components taken as committed; missing repositories, references and
  commits, ambiguous names, redirects, sign-in, protocol version 0, a
  `# service` line, an unreachable server; the form.
- [`crates/pane/tests/repositories.rs`](../crates/pane/tests/repositories.rs):
  the form, the source-only explanation, preview, Install in view and the
  command running in the native window at Pane's size.
- The native smokes' own phase (frames 300 to 304;
  [Linux](platforms/linux.md#git-packages-46)).

## Limits

- Public repositories over HTTPS only: no SSH, credentials, proxies or
  private hosts' sign-in; SHA-256 repositories are refused.
- The package must be at the repository's root; submodules and Git LFS are
  not fetched.
- No automatic updates of tracked branches yet (#50), no check for a newer
  commit other than choosing the repository again, no history browser and
  no publishing to a host.
- Signed tags and commits are not checked; the commit id, checked object by
  object, is the pin, and it proves contents, not provenance: a fork's
  commit served at the repository's address is only cautioned about.
- Tags and branches are resolved on the server; a server that does not
  allow fetching an unadvertised commit id refuses a commit named by its id
  (GitHub, GitLab and Git's own server allow it).
- The pack and its objects are held in memory while the revision is written
  (at most 64 MiB and 256 MiB).
- Only github.com, gitlab.com, bitbucket.org and codeberg.org fold the
  path's case; another host that ignores case (a self-hosted GitLab, say)
  makes `Owner/Repo` and `owner/repo` two packages.
- The HTTPS path to a real host is not exercised by the checks, which never
  reach the network ([by hand](#trying-a-real-host-by-hand)).
