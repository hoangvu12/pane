# Development mode: build and reload on save

Added for [#12](https://github.com/hoangvu12/pane/issues/12) (Rust) and
[#13](https://github.com/hoangvu12/pane/issues/13) (JavaScript and
TypeScript): US19, US51, US53, T07, T08, G1, G3; contributions, not a claim
that the whole scenario or gate passes. An author edits an extension, saves,
and sees the new behavior while Pane stays open ([ADR 0004](adr/0004-reload-extensions-without-restarting-launcher.md),
Q14). It builds on [reload](../guests/README.md#reloading-a-package-while-pane-stays-open)
(#11) and [pausing](pausing.md) (#16).

## Trying it

The development samples are one command each, "Say hello", which answers
with a `GREETING` constant; each builds in its own folder, as an author's
package would.

**Rust** ([`guests/hello-rust`](../guests/hello-rust)):

1. Build it once, from the repository root:
   `cd guests/hello-rust && cargo build --release --target wasm32-wasip2`.
   (Outside this repository, copy the folder, point `pane-guest`'s `path`
   in `Cargo.toml` at `guests/pane-guest` of a Pane checkout and copy
   `rust-toolchain.toml` beside it.)
2. `cargo run -p pane -- --install guests/hello-rust`, and Enter on
   **Install**.
3. In **Manage extensions…**, choose **Develop Hello Rust** (the list's
   last rows). The status says which command each save runs.
4. Edit `GREETING` in `guests/hello-rust/src/lib.rs` and save. The status
   shows "Building Hello Rust: cargo build --release --target
   wasm32-wasip2 --message-format=json-render-diagnostics…", then
   "Reloaded Hello Rust"; "Say hello" answers with the new text.
5. Save something that does not compile (`const GREETING: &str = 42;`): the
   status says "Hello Rust did not build: error[E0308]: mismatched types.
   It keeps running its installed code; …", and **Why Hello Rust did not
   build** in Manage extensions shows the compiler's output. "Say hello"
   still answers as before. Fix it and save: it is reloaded.
6. **Stop developing Hello Rust** ends it.

**JavaScript and TypeScript** ([`guests/hello-js`](../guests/hello-js),
[`guests/hello-ts`](../guests/hello-ts)) need the JS toolchain
([prerequisites](../guests/README.md#writing-a-javascript-or-typescript-command)):

1. Build once: `python3 tools/componentize-js/pane_js.py build
   guests/hello-ts guests/hello-ts/dist/hello_ts.wasm`.
2. Install `guests/hello-ts`, choose **Develop Hello TypeScript**, edit
   `GREETING` in `src/index.ts` and save. A type error
   (`const GREETING: string = 42;`) is shown as "Hello TypeScript did not
   build: src/index.ts(12,7): error TS2322: …".

The Pane window must be one built from a checkout (`cargo run -p pane`),
which knows where `tools/componentize-js/pane_js.py` is; otherwise set
`PANE_COMPONENTIZE_JS` to that file.

## What Pane does

Development is turned on per installed, enabled package, from its **Develop
<title>** row, and runs in the background:

1. **Watching.** Pane watches the package's source folder (its identity,
   `local:` and the folder, resolved to its canonical path, as FSEvents
   reports it) with the system's file watcher ([notify](https://docs.rs/notify/8.2.0)
   8.2: inotify on Linux, FSEvents on macOS, `ReadDirectoryChangesW` on
   Windows). It watches the folder itself and each top-level folder that is
   not the build's; a folder created or moved to the top later is watched
   when it appears. These are never saves, at any depth: anything inside a
   `target/`, `node_modules/` or `dist/` folder; `Cargo.lock` (Rust); the
   components `pane.json` names and the top-level folder they are in;
   hidden files and folders (`.git`); and editors' temporary files (vim's
   `4913` probe and `.swp`/`.swo`/`.swx` swap files, `name~` backups,
   JetBrains' `___jb_tmp___` and `___jb_old___`, Emacs's `.#name` and
   `#name#`). Reading a file is not a save.
2. **Building.** After a save, once nothing more is saved for 150 ms (an
   editor's several writes are one save), Pane copies `pane.json` to a
   staging folder of the build's own, under Pane's data folder
   (`extensions/develop/<hash of the identity>/staging/build-<n>`), and runs
   the package's build in the source folder, one adapter per language, the
   command the guest README documents:

   | Folder has | Build |
   | --- | --- |
   | `Cargo.toml` | `cargo build --release --target wasm32-wasip2 --message-format=json-render-diagnostics`. The component taken is the `.wasm` of that name that cargo's messages report built by this run, wherever the target folder is (a workspace member's, `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`, `build.target-dir`), never an older file where `pane.json` points; if cargo built none of that name, the build fails: "cargo built no <name> this time, …". |
   | `package.json` | `python3 <pane_js.py> build <folder> <staging>/<component>` for each component `pane.json` names; a failure of `pane_js.py` itself is one line starting `pane-js: error:` |
   | neither | Not developed: "Cannot develop <title>: … has neither Cargo.toml (Rust) nor package.json (JavaScript or TypeScript) …" |

   **Tools.** Cargo is `cargo` on `PATH` (rustup's proxy, so the folder's
   `rust-toolchain.toml` applies), else `~/.cargo/bin/cargo`
   (`%USERPROFILE%\.cargo\bin\cargo.exe` on Windows). Python is
   `PANE_PYTHON`, else `python3` on `PATH`, else on Windows `python`,
   skipping the Microsoft Store stub in `WindowsApps`. Without one, "Cannot
   develop <title>: Pane found no cargo … (it looked for …)" names where it
   looked.

   **Environment.** A build runs with Pane's environment, so the author's
   cargo configuration applies (`CARGO_HOME`, `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`, registry
   tokens, `CARGO_HTTP_*`, `CARGO_NET_OFFLINE`, proxies). Only what
   `cargo run` or `cargo test` set for Pane itself is removed: `CARGO`,
   `CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR`, `CARGO_MANIFEST_PATH`, `CARGO_PKG_*`,
   `CARGO_BIN_NAME`, `CARGO_CRATE_NAME`, `CARGO_PRIMARY_PACKAGE`,
   `CARGO_BIN_EXE_*`, `CARGO_TARGET_TMPDIR`, `CARGO_RUSTC_CURRENT_DIR`,
   `OUT_DIR`, `RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN`, `RUSTC` and `RUSTDOC`, and the
   `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`/`DYLD_*` entries cargo added for Pane's target and
   toolchain folders. (`pane_js.py` strips every `CARGO_*` but
   `CARGO_HOME` for the toolchain it builds itself.)

   **What a save runs.** Once development is on, any write to the folder
   (an editor's autosave, `git pull`, a sync client) runs the build,
   including a Rust package's `build.rs` and procedural macros, with the
   author's rights. That is what the author asked for by developing that
   package, for this session only; nothing is built for a package that is
   not developed.

   The status shows "Building <title>: <command>…". The build's standard
   output and error are read line by line (each line whole); the last 2,000
   lines (at most 256 KiB) are kept in memory, and all of it is written to
   `extensions/develop/<hash>/build.log` in Pane's data folder.
3. **A build that fails** replaces nothing: the package keeps running its
   installed code. The status says "<title> did not build: <first error>.
   It keeps running its installed code; the diagnostics are under "Why
   <title> did not build" in Manage extensions." The first error is the
   first line that rustc or cargo (`error:`, `error[E0308]:`), TypeScript
   (`error TS2322`) or `pane_js.py` (`pane-js: error:`) report as one; a
   line such as `Compiling thiserror` is not; without one, why the build
   failed (the command and its exit code). The log is kept as
   `failed-build.log`, and **Why <title> did not build** opens the command,
   the folder, the log's path and the last 60 lines of the output, with
   **Build <title> again**. Pane's standard error gets one line: the first
   error and the log's path. The row goes once a build succeeds.
4. **A build that succeeds** is reloaded from its staging folder exactly as
   **Reload <title>** reloads the source folder: checked as an install
   checks it (a component that does not pass is "not reloaded", the code
   keeps running), then replacing the managed copy and starting each
   available command. A start that fails pauses the package with Retry and
   diagnostics, and **the earlier code is not restored** (Q31,
   [pausing](pausing.md)); the next save that builds reloads it, which ends
   the pause. Settings are kept; nothing live is carried over. The
   components are then copied to where `pane.json` names them in the source
   folder, so a later **Reload** reloads the same build. If the package is
   being changed otherwise when the build ends (a **Reload**, an update),
   the build waits for that to end; a save meanwhile makes it obsolete.
5. **Saving during a build** makes that build obsolete: it runs to its end
   (it is not killed), but is never reloaded, and the folder is built
   again. Builds of one package run one at a time, and each reload ends
   before the next build starts, so an older build never replaces a newer
   one. What an obsolete build left where `pane.json` names the components
   (cargo's `target`) is replaced with the installed components, so a later
   **Reload** cannot pick it up. After three obsolete builds in a row the
   status says "<title> was not reloaded: its sources kept changing during
   3 builds in a row. Save again to build it.", and Pane waits for the next
   save.
6. **The status line.** A development status is shown on Manage
   extensions, a build's details and root search with nothing typed. On
   another screen (an open command, a form, a query's results) it does not
   replace what that screen says; the newest is shown when the user returns
   to Manage extensions or root search.

Only the developed package is built and reloaded; Pane and every other
package keep running.

## When development ends

When the author chooses **Stop developing <title>**, disables or
uninstalls the package, or Pane quits (and when the launcher is dropped, as
in tests). The watcher is dropped, and a running build's processes are
killed before that action returns; a build that ends after it is dropped
without a word. Enabling the package again does not develop it again.

- **macOS and Linux:** the build runs in a process group of its own, killed
  with `SIGKILL`. After its command exits, what is left of the group is
  killed too, and its output is read for at most 2 more seconds, so a
  daemon it started that holds the pipes cannot hold Pane. On Linux the
  command also gets `SIGKILL` if Pane dies without quitting
  (`PR_SET_PDEATHSIG`); macOS has no such signal, so there a build
  outlives a Pane that is killed or crashes.
- **Windows:** the build runs in a Job Object that kills its processes when
  closed (`JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE`), so they die when
  development stops and when Pane ends however it ends; it also runs in a
  new process group (`CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP`), without a console window.
  A process the command starts in the instant before it is assigned to the
  job escapes it.

## Local and published copies

Development applies to one installation, identified by its source folder
([identity](../guests/README.md#packaging-and-installing-a-local-extension)).
Another installed copy of the same package, from another folder (the
"published" copy, until npm and Git sources exist), is never built,
reloaded, disabled or swapped for it (Q30): both stay listed, each with its
own commands, settings and code, and a published copy without sources is
explained ("Cannot develop <title>: …") rather than developed.

## Choices to confirm (provisional)

These are implementation choices of #12/#13, not user decisions:

- Development is turned on per package in Manage extensions and is **not
  recorded**: it ends when Pane quits, and starting it does not build at
  once (the next save does).
- The build is chosen by the folder's `Cargo.toml` or `package.json`, with
  the documented commands; a package cannot declare a build of its own.
- A save during a build lets that build finish and builds again, rather than
  killing it; after three obsolete builds in a row Pane waits for the next
  save rather than reloading the last one that built.
- A build failure is shown in the status line and a details row, not as a
  separate notification; the details show the last 60 lines and the log's
  path.
- **Build <title> again** on the details screen reruns the build without a
  save.
- A development status waits on screens other than Manage extensions, a
  build's details and an empty root search.
- `pane_js.py` runs `tsc` in the staged copy of the package, so a type
  error names the file as the package has it (`src/index.ts(12,7)`).
- Reloading on save starts every available command, as a manual reload does
  (the provisional exception to lazy activation in
  [current decisions](current-decisions.md)).
- The rows are near the end of Manage extensions, one per enabled
  package, after the hotkey rows and before retained data.

## Checks

- [`crates/pane-core/tests/develop.rs`](../crates/pane-core/tests/develop.rs)
  drives development through the launcher with the system's file watcher
  and a stand-in build that stages a real guest, waiting on what the
  development reports (and on a second developed package's build, to know
  that a save was not acted on) rather than on fixed pauses: a save
  reloads only that package (another keeps its code); a build that fails
  keeps the code and shows its first error, output and log, which Build
  again reruns, and a fix reloads it; a build that fails to start is
  paused with Retry and not rolled back, and the next save recovers it; a
  save during a build makes it obsolete (only the newer build is reloaded
  and copied to the source folder), and an obsolete build's leftovers are
  replaced with the installed code for a later Reload; three obsolete
  builds in a row wait for the next save; a build that ends during a
  Reload waits for it, and one that ends after development stopped is
  dropped without a word; stopping, disabling, uninstalling and dropping
  the launcher each stop the running build and the watcher; a status does
  not replace an open command's answer and is shown back at root search; a
  folder moved into the source folder is watched, and editors' temporary
  files are not saves; a published copy keeps its identity and code; the
  rows in Manage extensions; the window is told of each change.
- [`crates/pane-core/tests/develop_builds.rs`](../crates/pane-core/tests/develop_builds.rs)
  runs the real builds on copies of the samples: an edit is built and
  reloaded, a compile or type error keeps the code and shows the compiler's
  first error and output, with the log, a fix reloads it; a Rust package
  with its own `build.target-dir` reloads what cargo built this time, not
  the older file where `pane.json` points, and a component cargo did not
  build is refused. The Rust tests run in `cargo xtask ci`; the JavaScript
  and TypeScript ones need the JS toolchain and run with
  `PANE_TEST_JS_BUILDS=1` (CI's JS/TS job sets it).
- Unit tests in [`develop.rs`](../crates/pane-core/src/develop.rs): the
  adapters' commands (paths with spaces quoted) and ignored paths, a folder
  without a known build or tool, the first error (not `thiserror`),
  cargo's artifact messages, which variables are removed, the bounded
  output and its log, whole lines from both pipes, and (Unix) stopping a
  command kills what it started at once, a command whose child keeps the
  pipes open still returns, and one whose daemon (outside the group) keeps
  them open returns after the 2-second drain.
- [`crates/pane/tests/develop.rs`](../crates/pane/tests/develop.rs): the
  window redraws by itself when a background build fails and when the fix
  is reloaded, and renders the diagnostics.
- The native smokes' development phase (screenshots 110 to 136; see the
  [platform notes](platforms/linux.md#development-mode-12-13)).

## Limits

- A build has no timeout: one that hangs holds the package's development
  until it ends or development stops.
- On macOS, a Pane that is killed or crashes leaves a running build to
  finish on its own (see above); a daemon a build starts in a session of
  its own (`setsid`) is not killed anywhere but Windows.
- The JS/TS build needs a Pane checkout's `pane_js.py` (and its toolchain);
  an installed Pane without a checkout cannot build JS/TS on save.
- Native evidence is from Linux (X11) only; the macOS and Windows smokes run
  the same phase, not yet run there. The platform code (process groups, the
  Job Object, the watcher) was compile- and lint-checked for Windows and
  macOS targets from Linux.
