# Dependencies on other extensions

Added for [#42](https://github.com/hoangvu12/pane/issues/42) (US25–US29, T12,
T14, G4), following the accepted Q26 direction in the
[extension policies](extension-policy-proposal.md#dependencies-on-other-extensions).
A package that calls other packages' [operations](operations.md) declares
them in its `pane.json`, required or optional. Installing it from a local
folder shows them first and installs the missing required ones with it;
optional, disabled, paused and already installed dependencies are left as
they are. Disabling or uninstalling a required dependency together with its
dependents is [#43](https://github.com/hoangvu12/pane/issues/43) and
[#44](https://github.com/hoangvu12/pane/issues/44); npm sources are
[#45](https://github.com/hoangvu12/pane/issues/45).

## Declaring

```json
"dependencies": [
  {
    "id": "greeter",
    "source": "local:../sample-operations-js",
    "operations": [{ "id": "greet", "version": 1 }]
  },
  {
    "id": "rust-greeter",
    "source": "local:../sample-operations",
    "optional": true,
    "operations": [{ "id": "greet", "version": 1 }],
    "platforms": ["windows", "linux"]
  }
]
```

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | The name the package's code calls the dependency by, unique in the package: lowercase letters, digits and `-`. It has no `:`, so it is never mistaken for a package identity. |
| `source` | `local:` and a folder path, relative to the declaring package's folder or absolute. Anything else, `npm:` and `git:` included, is an invalid manifest ("… must be `local:` followed by a folder path; other sources are not supported yet"): #45 defines npm sources. |
| `optional` | `false` (the default) for a required dependency, `true` for an optional one. |
| `operations` | Every operation the package calls there, each with the version it calls; at least one. This is the compatibility requirement (an operation's version is the version of its input and result, [operations](operations.md#publishing)), and the only operations a call through the id reaches. |
| `platforms` | Optional: the systems on which the package needs it. Elsewhere it is neither installed nor checked, and a call to it that finds it missing is `unavailable`. |

There is no version range on the package itself: a package's `version` is
free text, and what a dependent relies on is the operations it calls at
their versions.

### Writing a local source

A `local:` path is written the same way on every system: folders separated
by `/`, as `local:../greeter` or `local:shared/greeter`, or absolute from
`/` (meaningful on macOS and Linux). A path with `\`, a drive letter
(`local:C:/…`) or a `//server` share is refused on every system, with "…
must separate folders with `/`, without a drive letter, `\` or a
`//server` share, so that every system reads it alike (such as
`local:../greeter`)", so that a package written on Windows resolves alike on
macOS and Linux.

## Addressing

Pane resolves a `local:` source against the declaring package's source
folder **as Pane resolved it**: a package installed through a symbolic link
(or a Windows junction) is identified by the folder the link points to, and
its relative sources are relative to that folder, not to the link's. A
source folder that exists is resolved as an installed folder is (the
operating system's absolute path, following links; [identity](../guests/README.md#packaging-and-installing-a-local-extension)).
For one that does not exist yet, `.` and `..` are removed from its spelling
and its deepest existing parent folder is resolved by the operating system,
so it matches the identity the folder gets once it is created. What each
dependency resolved to is recorded with the package in `installed.json`
(`"dependencies": [{ "id": "greeter", "local": "/…" }]`), so a source folder
moved or deleted after installing changes nothing. If no installed package
has the recorded identity, a call resolves the recorded folder again, so a
folder that became a link to an installed package after the dependent was
installed still reaches it.

A guest calls a dependency with its id where it would give an identity:

```rust
call("greeter".into(), "greet".into(), 1, input).await
```

Pane finds the caller's package from the calling component, looks the id up
in its manifest and uses the recorded identity; the call then behaves as a
call by identity ([operations](operations.md#calling)). Only the operations
and versions the declaration lists are reached through the id; calls by
identity are not limited. The errors for an id:

| Kind | When |
| --- | --- |
| `refused` | The declaration does not list that operation at that version: "Caller declares that it calls `greet` version 1 through its dependency `greeter`, not `wait` version 1; declare it in its pane.json to call it". |
| `not-found` | The caller declares no dependency with that id ("Caller declares no dependency `nobody` in its pane.json, …; it declares `greeter` and `helper`"), or it is not installed: for a required one "Caller requires `greeter` from local folder …, which is not installed; install Caller again to install it", for an optional one "Caller's optional dependency `helper` from local folder … is not installed; install it to use it". |
| `unavailable` | It is needed only on other systems and not installed. |
| `disabled` and the rest | As for any call once the target is found. |

## Installing

Previewing a package (**Install extension from folder…** or
`pane --install <folder>`) works out its dependencies before offering
Install, reading only manifests and checking components without running
them, and lists them under the package's details, each source as declared
(relative to the Source line's folder):

- "Requires: JavaScript operations sample, installed with it from
  local:../sample-operations-js": missing, installed with it. The Install
  row then says "…, and install JavaScript operations sample, which it
  requires" (or "the N extensions it requires").
- "Requires: …, already installed": used as it is.
- "Requires: …, which you disabled: it stays disabled, and <title> cannot
  use it until you enable it in Manage extensions": the package is
  installed, the dependency is not enabled, and the status after installing
  says so again. Calls to it answer `disabled`.
- "Requires: …, installed but it is paused after an error; retry it in
  Manage extensions": Pane [paused](pausing.md) it; it stays paused, and
  the status after installing says so again.
- "Requires (for B): C, …": a dependency of a dependency Pane installs.
- "Optional: `rust-greeter` from local:../sample-operations, not installed:
  Pane does not install it; install it yourself to use it", or "Optional:
  <title>, installed" (or "installed but disabled").
- "Not needed on this system: `x` from local:../x (only on Windows)".

### Installing what the preview showed

The Install row carries what its plan assumed: the requested manifest, and
for each package it relies on, either the manifest it would install from
that folder, or the installed copy (managed folder, enabled, paused) it
would use. Choosing Install checks that the installed packages are still as
assumed and **claims** the requested package and every one it relies on:
until the install ends, uninstalling, reloading, updating, enabling or
disabling one, or deleting retained data it would reclaim, is refused with
"<title> is part of an install in progress". The install then reads the
folders and works the plan out again. If anything differs (a folder's
`pane.json` changed, a package was installed, uninstalled or changed
meanwhile), nothing is installed and the preview shows the new plan with
"What installing <title> needs changed since it was shown; check it again
and choose Install once more". An install without a preview
(`Launcher::install_package`; `pane --install` opens the preview) works the
plan out, then claims the same way before installing.

Installing then adds the missing required packages, each after its own
required dependencies, then the requested one, and shows "Installed Caller
with JavaScript operations sample, which it requires". An Update does the
same for a new copy that adds a required dependency ("Updated Caller with
…").

### What stops an install

Every problem with a required dependency is found before anything changes;
the preview is then titled "Cannot install <title>" with no Install row, and
the status (also for an install without preview) starts "Nothing was
installed:", listing each:

- **Unavailable**: its folder is missing or not a package, it is
  source-only, it is for other systems, or its components do not pass
  Pane's checks.
- **Incompatible**: it does not publish an operation the dependent calls, or
  publishes it at another version, or not on this system.
- **Pinned**: an installed dependency that is incompatible is not replaced.
  When a newer copy in its folder might publish what is called, Pane says
  "…; Pane does not replace the installed copy of <title> while installing
  another extension: update it from its folder if a newer copy publishes
  it". Installing never updates another package.
- **Conflicting**: two packages in the install need different versions of
  one operation from the same source: "A and C need different versions of
  `echo` from B (1 and 2); Pane installs one copy of each source, so they
  conflict". There is one installed copy per source and no solver choosing
  among versions, so no update advice is given.
- **Itself**: a package naming its own folder as a dependency.
- **Too many**: more than 16 packages would be installed with it
  (`MAX_INSTALLED_WITH`).

An optional dependency never stops an install, whatever its state.

### Cycles

Each source is visited once, so packages that require each other (A needs
B, B needs A) are installed together, A last; what each needs of the other
is still checked. An installed dependency's own dependencies are not
visited again: it was installed with them, or they were removed since
(#43, #44).

### Partial installation

Installing writes one package at a time. If one fails (a storage error, or
another install of the same source finishing first), Pane removes again the
packages this install added, most recent first, with their managed copies,
putting back the record of [retained data](extension-data.md#retained-data)
one of them had at its place among the others, so nothing is left installed
without its required dependencies and nothing claims to be ready. The
status names what failed: "Could not install C, which it requires: …". Only
if removing one again fails does it stay installed, and the status says so
("Pane could not remove again what it had installed, which stays installed:
B (…)"). None of the packages ran meanwhile, so none has data to lose.

## For later slices

A plan (`crates/pane-core/src/dependencies.rs`) is data: its required edges
name the dependent and the target by identity with the target's state, its
problems are a kind with identities, and its wording is only in `Display`
and `Plan::lines`, so the dependent traversal of #43 and #44 can reuse the
recorded graph (`InstalledPackage::dependency_identity`) without the
wording.

## Checks

- [`crates/pane-core/tests/dependencies.rs`](../crates/pane-core/tests/dependencies.rs)
  drives the preview, installing with a missing required dependency and the
  cross-language call by id (JavaScript calling Rust), calls limited to the
  declared operations, optional, installed, disabled, paused, pinned,
  conflicting and unavailable dependencies, cycles, dependencies of
  dependencies, the 16-package limit, `.` and `..`, symbolic links (a
  package installed through one, a dependency folder that became one),
  refused Windows-style and non-local sources, an update adding a
  dependency, a dependency uninstalled later, changes between the preview
  and Install, packages refused to change during an install, and the
  sample.
- Unit tests in [`dependencies.rs`](../crates/pane-core/src/dependencies.rs)
  inject a failing install to check the rollback, including where retained
  data is put back.
- The native smokes install the [dependencies sample](../guests/sample-dependencies/src/lib.rs)
  and show "Hello, Pane, from JavaScript" in the real window (frames 66 to
  68; [Linux](platforms/linux.md#dependencies-42)).

## Limits

- Local folders only; npm and Git (#45 and later) keep these semantics.
- One copy per source, no version ranges and no multi-version solving.
- No Pane-side view yet of installed packages whose required dependency was
  disabled or removed later; their calls explain it (#43, #44).
- A second install relying on a package an install in progress has claimed
  is refused rather than waiting.
- The symbolic-link tests are skipped where the system does not allow
  links (Windows without the privilege); Windows junctions are untested.
