# Windows native baseline (#5, #6)

Recorded 2026-09-28 from GitHub Actions run
[36366760796](https://github.com/wasimysaid/pane/actions/runs/36366760796) on the
fork `wasimysaid/pane`, commit `572d629`.

## Tested combination

| | |
| --- | --- |
| OS | Windows Server 2025 Datacenter, `Microsoft Windows NT 10.0.26100.0` (build 26100) |
| Architecture | x86_64 (`AMD64`) |
| Machine | GitHub-hosted runner, image `windows-2025-vs2026` version 20260922.246.2 |
| Session | the runner's interactive desktop session (Explorer shell, taskbar) |
| Toolchain | MSVC from the image's Visual Studio; Rust 1.98.1 (`rust-toolchain.toml`) |

**Not tested, so not claimed:** Windows 10/11 client editions, ARM64, a physical
display or GPU driver other than the runner's, high-DPI scaling, and any
installer or signed build.

## Fresh checkout build and checks

```powershell
rustup toolchain install
cargo xtask ci          # guests, prebuilt JS/TS check, fmt, clippy, all tests
cargo build --locked -p pane
```

Result: `cargo xtask ci` passed (13 window, 9 launcher-model, 1 runtime-cache
and 25 sample-contract tests), and the launcher built. The Rust guests are built
natively; the JS and TS samples use the committed prebuilt components.
Rebuilding them from source on Windows (`cargo xtask js-guests`) has **not**
been run. The Cargo cache was warm (`Swatinem/rust-cache`).

## Native GUI smoke

```powershell
cargo build -p pane
./scripts/smoke-windows.ps1 -OutDir smoke   # needs Python 3 with Pillow
```

The script launches `target\debug\pane.exe` and waits for its main window. It
then brings the window to the foreground and sends real key events with
`SendKeys`. For each of the Rust, JavaScript and TypeScript sample commands it
presses Enter to open it, Down and Enter to run "Wait briefly" (an async WASI 0.3
clock import inside the guest), then Escape.

It fails if the window does not appear or Pane exits. The same three screenshot
checks as on macOS and Linux also run (`scripts/check_screenshot.py`):

- The root screen draws text in the hint color.
- Each result screen draws text in the result color.
- The three result screens are all different.

Screenshots, cropped to the window (and inspected):

| Step | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Root search lists the three sample commands | [1-root.png](evidence/windows/1-root.png) |
| Rust command opened; action result "Waited 50 ms inside the Rust guest" | [2-command-0.png](evidence/windows/2-command-0.png), [2-result-0.png](evidence/windows/2-result-0.png) |
| JavaScript command; "Waited 50 ms inside the JavaScript guest" | [3-command-1.png](evidence/windows/3-command-1.png), [3-result-1.png](evidence/windows/3-result-1.png) |
| TypeScript command; "Waited 50 ms inside the TypeScript guest" | [4-command-2.png](evidence/windows/4-command-2.png), [4-result-2.png](evidence/windows/4-result-2.png) |
| Escape returns to root search | [5-back-to-root.png](evidence/windows/5-back-to-root.png) |

Rendering, keyboard focus, selection, guest execution and result display all
worked natively. In the root screenshots the TypeScript row also has a lighter
background. This is most likely hover under wherever the runner's mouse pointer
sits, since keyboard selection (the Rust row) opened the Rust command. This was
not confirmed.

## Platform availability (#19)

The smoke also runs the platform-availability steps (screenshots 13 to 15,
[platform availability](../platform-availability.md#checks)): the Rust
command's Windows-only and macOS-and-Linux actions, then a package listing
only the two other systems. **These steps have not run on this system yet**;
only the Linux X11 run and the host-interface tests' expectations for this
system exist, so the availability results here are unverified natively.

## Text input and accessibility findings

- **Text input / IME (#20):** the smoke now also opens the Rust command's
  form, submits it empty (the error color must appear), types "Ada" with
  `SendKeys`, then Tab, Down and Enter (the result color must appear, which
  only happens if the typed text reached the name field). In run [36371205770](https://github.com/wasimysaid/pane/actions/runs/36371205770) (Windows NT
  10.0.26100, AMD64) every step passed and the result read "Good morning, Ada,
  from the Rust guest". Windows IME
  (TSF) composition, for example with Microsoft Japanese IME, is unverified;
  the window tests cover composition only on the field's editing state
  ([what that proves](../forms.md#checks)).

Screenshots from run [36371205770](https://github.com/wasimysaid/pane/actions/runs/36371205770) (commit `949e35d`), cropped to the window:

| Step | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Form opened; focus in the name field | [6-form.png](evidence/windows/6-form.png) |
| Submitted empty; "Enter a name" on the field and status | [7-form-error.png](evidence/windows/7-form-error.png) |
| Typed "Ada", Tab, Down to "Good morning", submitted | [8-form-result.png](evidence/windows/8-form-result.png) |

- **Accessibility:** see [accessibility of forms](../forms.md#accessibility).
  Narrator/NVDA were not run.

## Local extension package (#9)

`scripts/smoke-windows.ps1` also installs `target/guests/packages/sample-rust` with
`pane --install <folder>` (with `PANE_DATA_DIR` pointing at a fresh folder),
runs its command, and restarts Pane. In run [36371205770](https://github.com/wasimysaid/pane/actions/runs/36371205770) (commit `949e35d`) every
step passed. The `packages` identity tests also passed there: folder paths with
spaces and Unicode, letter case and Unicode normalization as this file system
treats them, and symbolic links. The symbolic-link test skips itself where
directory links are not allowed, and cargo hides that notice for a passing
test. The runner's administrator account can normally create them, but a skip
can't be ruled out from the log.

| Step | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Package screen: source, version, commands, compatibility | [9-package.png](evidence/windows/9-package.png) |
| Installed; the new command is selected in root search | [10-installed.png](evidence/windows/10-installed.png) |
| The installed command answers ("Hello from the Rust guest") | [11-installed-result.png](evidence/windows/11-installed-result.png) |
| Still listed after a restart | [12-restarted.png](evidence/windows/12-restarted.png) |

The installed copy has the same title as the built-in Rust sample, so the
screenshots can't show which copy opened; the core tests prove the installed
copy runs. In these screenshots the root list is taller than the window and its
last row is cut off; since #19 the list scrolls to keep the selected row
visible.

## Remaining limits

- Only a CI runner (Windows Server) was used, not a Windows 10/11 desktop.
- No screen reader (Narrator/NVDA) was run. The accessibility tree is verified
  only through GPUI in the platform-independent window tests.
- The smoke confirms that text appears in the expected colors and that the
  three results differ. Which command and guest each screenshot shows was
  checked by inspection.
