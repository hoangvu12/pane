# Extension data

Added for [#39](https://github.com/hoangvu12/pane/issues/39) (US60, US64, T20,
G5; contributions, not whole-gate claims). It implements the accepted
[Clear cache](extension-policy-proposal.md#disable-cache-data-and-uninstall)
behavior: remove disposable data and keep settings, user content and
credentials, controlled by Pane rather than by running the extension.
[#40](https://github.com/hoangvu12/pane/issues/40) adds
[uninstalling](#uninstalling-an-extension) with a choice to keep or delete
the saved data.

## Four kinds of data

An installed package's commands keep string values by key through Pane, one
`pane:extension` interface per kind ([`wit/data.wit`](../wit/data.wit), world
`extension-with-data`;
Rust `pane_guest::{settings, content, cache, credentials}`, JS/TS modules
`pane:extension/<kind>@0.1.0`, typed in
[`guests/js/data.d.ts`](../guests/js/data.d.ts)). Each interface has
the same `get` and `set`; the kind is what decides what Pane's management
actions do with a value.

| Kind | What it is for | File in `extensions/` | Clear cache | Uninstall |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Settings | The user's choices for the extension | `settings.json` | kept | the user's choice |
| Content | The extension's own durable records, such as notes or history | `content.json` | kept | the user's choice |
| Cache | Values the extension can compute or download again | `cache.json` | removed | removed |
| Local credentials (`credentials`) | Secrets kept on this computer, such as a sign-in token | `credentials.json`, readable only by the user on macOS and Linux (mode 0600) | kept | removed |

The settings sample in [Rust](../guests/sample-settings/src/lib.rs),
[JavaScript](../guests/sample-settings-js/src/index.js) and
[TypeScript](../guests/sample-settings-ts/src/index.ts) keeps one value of
each: its greeting style, a note ("Save a note"), the last greeting ("Greet
me") and a token ("Sign in"). "Show what Pane keeps" answers with all four.

## Ownership

- Pane owns the files. Each holds every installed package's values of its
  kind under the package identity's key, so values belong to the source
  identity, never the title or the managed copy: two copies with the same
  title have separate data, and an update keeps it. Nothing is kept for a
  command built into Pane (`get` and `set` return an error).
- The extension owns its keys and the meaning of its values. Pane never reads
  them except to hand them back.
- Everything is kept while the package is disabled, updated or Pane is not
  running. A disabled package cannot `set` any kind.
- The files live next to `installed.json` in Pane's data folder, not in Pane's
  own compile cache (`cache_dir`, compiled components keyed by their bytes,
  which Pane manages itself and which Clear cache does not touch). An
  extension's cache is its data, owned by its identity like the other kinds;
  it is only disposable.
- Nothing outside these files is Pane's to delete: the package's source
  folder, files an extension wrote elsewhere, remote accounts and sessions.

## Migration

- Pane migrates the files' format: each has a `version` (now 1). A file of
  another version, or one that cannot be read, is reported to the extension
  by `get` and `set` and never overwritten.
- The extension migrates its own values when their meaning changes between
  its versions, in its own code. Pane keeps values across an update and does
  not transform them.
- A cache needs no migration: an extension should treat a cache value it
  cannot use as missing and make it again, since the user can clear it at any
  time.

## Clearing an extension's cache

Manage extensions lists, after each package's enable/disable row, a row
"Clear cache of <title>" per package, in the same order; its subtitle names
the source, so copies with the same title can be told apart. Choosing it asks
first: "Clear the cache of <title>?", the source, and "Pane deletes the data
this extension keeps as its cache. Its settings, content and credentials are
kept, and the extension does not run." Choosing Clear cache deletes that
identity's entry from `cache.json` and returns to the list with "Cleared the
cache of <title>"; Cancel or Esc returns without deleting. Pane reads
`cache.json` again just before, so another Pane process's values saved
meanwhile are kept.

- No guest runs: the package may be disabled, its component may not load and
  Pane's runtime may not have started. Its running instance, if any, is left
  as it is; the next `cache.get` returns nothing, but the instance may save a
  value it still holds, so the outcome then reads "Cleared the cache of
  <title>. A running instance may write it again until it stops."
- Other identities' caches, every other kind of data and every file outside
  `cache.json` stay as they were.
- If `cache.json` cannot be read, nothing is deleted and the error says so:
  "Could not clear the cache of <title>: Cannot read <path>: <reason>.
  Nothing was deleted. That file holds only extension caches: repair or delete
  it, then clear the cache again." Pane reads the file again on the next
  attempt, so no restart is needed. If it cannot be written, the error names
  the file and asks the user to check that Pane can write its folder.

## Uninstalling an extension

Added for [#40](https://github.com/hoangvu12/pane/issues/40) (US61, US63,
US64, T20, G5; contributions). It implements the accepted
[Uninstall](extension-policy-proposal.md#disable-cache-data-and-uninstall)
behavior for one package; uninstalling required dependents together is #44.

Manage extensions lists, after the Clear cache rows, a row "Uninstall
<title>" per package, whose subtitle names the source. Choosing it asks
first, "Uninstall <title>?", with:

- "From <source>";
- "Pane removes its installed copy, its cache and its credentials on this
  computer, and the extension does not run. Deleting a credential does not
  sign you out of an online service.";
- "Saved data: 1 setting and 1 content record" (or "none"): the package's
  **saved data**, its settings and content, which is what the choice is
  about;
- "Its source folder <path> and files it saved elsewhere are not touched."

and three rows: **Uninstall and keep saved data** (first, so Enter keeps),
**Uninstall and delete saved data** and **Cancel** (Esc too).

| Kind | Keep saved data | Delete saved data |
|---|---|---|
| Settings | kept | removed |
| Content | kept | removed |
| Cache | removed | removed |
| Local credentials | removed | removed |
| Managed copy (`packages/<n>/`) | removed | removed |
| Source folder, files elsewhere, remote sessions | untouched | untouched |

Choosing a row applies at once in the launcher: the package leaves root
search, Manage extensions and the targets of [operations](operations.md)
(a call to it is then "not-found"), its instances stop (a call already
running finishes first, as for disable), an open command, form or view of
it closes, and it can no longer save any data. No guest runs, so a broken or
disabled package, or a Pane whose runtime did not start, uninstalls the same
way. Then Pane:

1. records the uninstall in `installed.json`. If it cannot, nothing else
   changes, the package is back as it was and the error ends "It is still
   installed and nothing was deleted.";
2. removes each kind the choice covers, each file read again first like
   Clear cache, so other identities' values and another Pane's writes are
   kept;
3. removes the managed copy. A folder that cannot be removed, as on Windows
   while a file in it is in use, is listed in `installed.json` like an
   update's replaced copy and removed at the next start.

It returns to the extension list with "Uninstalled <title>; its settings and
content are kept" or "Uninstalled <title> and deleted its saved data". If
step 2 or 3 fails, the outcome is an error rather than a success, naming
what remains: "Uninstalled <title>, but could not delete its cache: Cannot
read <path>: <reason>." or "…, but its installed copy in <path> could not be
removed yet (<reason>); Pane removes it when it next starts."

### Retained data

Extension data kept for an identity that is not installed is **retained
data**. `installed.json` lists it under `retained`, with the source and the
title the package had, so that it stays manageable without the package
([#41](https://github.com/hoangvu12/pane/issues/41), which deletes it later,
reads this list; `Launcher::retained_data` returns it):

```json
"retained": [{ "local": "/home/me/greeter", "title": "Greeter" }]
```

- It is recorded, in the same write as the uninstall, when the user keeps
  saved data and the package has some. It is also recorded after "delete"
  when a kind could not be removed, so data left behind is not lost track
  of.
- The values stay in the kind files under the identity's key. Installing the
  same source again drops the record, and the package finds its settings and
  content (not its cache or credentials, which were removed). Pane restarting
  in between changes nothing.
- Another source is another identity, even with the same title: it starts
  with nothing and never sees the retained data.

## Checks

- `crates/pane-core/tests/uninstall.rs`, for each language's settings
  sample: the confirmation, keep and reinstall (with a restart between), delete,
  Cancel and Esc; two copies with the same title, with the source folders and
  a user document unchanged byte for byte; another source with the same
  title not getting retained data; a disabled package with a garbage
  component uninstalled by a launcher without a runtime; an open command
  closed and its instance stopped; an `installed.json` that cannot be written
  (nothing changes); an unreadable `cache.json` (explained, the rest deleted,
  recorded as retained); on Unix, a managed folder that cannot be removed
  (explained, removed at the next start).
  `crates/pane-core/tests/operations.rs`: an uninstalled target is not found
  and its instance stops. `crates/pane/tests/install.rs`: the rows, the
  confirmation, Esc and the outcome in the native window. The native GUI
  smokes, screenshots 46 to 48: the confirmation, the outcome, and after
  reinstalling the same folder its style and note shown, signed out, with
  the files checked in between.
- `crates/pane-core/tests/clear_cache.rs`, for each language's settings sample:
  each kind before and after clearing, and after a restart; Cancel and Esc;
  two copies with the same title, with the source folders and a user document
  unchanged byte for byte; a disabled package whose managed component was
  replaced by garbage, cleared by a launcher without a runtime; an unreadable
  `cache.json`, unchanged with every other file, then cleared once deleted;
  another Pane's cache write between reading and clearing kept; the running
  instance note; `credentials.json` created, and rewritten, with mode 0600
  (Unix).
- `crates/pane/tests/install.rs`: the rows, confirmation text, Esc and the
  outcome in the native window.
- The native GUI smokes, screenshots 40 to 43: every kind shown, the
  confirmation, the outcome, and the cached greeting gone with the other
  kinds still shown and still in their files.

## Limits

- `get` and `set` only: an extension cannot delete one value or list its keys.
- Local credentials are plain text in Pane's data folder, not in the
  system's keychain ([decision](current-decisions.md#cross-cutting-details-preserved)).
  On macOS and Linux `credentials.json` is created with mode 0600, so other
  users of the computer cannot read it; on Windows it has its folder's
  permissions (normally the user's own profile). Nothing protects them from
  other extensions or programs running as the same user: the policy is
  lifecycle behavior, not secret isolation. Deleting a local credential never
  revokes a remote session.
- Clear cache covers `cache.json` only; an extension that writes cache files
  elsewhere has to manage them itself.
- The files are replaced atomically but not locked, as with settings: two
  Pane processes on one data folder can lose each other's last write.
- Uninstall removes an identity's entry from each file as Clear cache does;
  deleting retained data ([#41](https://github.com/hoangvu12/pane/issues/41))
  is not built yet, so retained data can only be deleted by installing the
  same source again and uninstalling it with "delete".
- Uninstall does not remove Pane's own compile cache entries: they are keyed
  by the components' bytes, may be shared with another package, and
  Wasmtime's cache trims them itself. They hold no extension data.
- A package that cannot run cannot be asked to sign out: deleting a local
  credential never revokes a remote session, and the confirmation says so.
